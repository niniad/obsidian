# Welcome to The Inspector Play Kit for months 7-8

Source: https://blog.lovevery.com/product-recommendations/welcome-to-the-inspector-play-kit-for-months-7-8/

You’ve got an inspector on your hands: an inquisitive, adventurous, intrepid baby, who may be working extremely hard to move their body forward. Whether they’re scooting, rolling, or even starting to crawl a bit, chances are they’re motivated and determined to inspect the world around them. Their babbling might be more frequent, and soon you may see signs of the all-important “pincer grasp:” when they pick up objects between a finger and a thumb.

In [The Inspector Play Kit](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-inspector), your baby has a whole new set of playthings, books and picture cards, and activities that are all geared towards how they learn and play best. The Nesting Stacking Dripdrop Cups, for example—which do even more than the name suggests—give your baby a chance to work on building towers, fitting things together, and what so many babies love most: a chance to experiment with water. The ‘Things I See’ Texture Cards lay a foundation for first words, and the First Puzzle encourages the development of your baby’s pincer grasp, or picking up objects between a finger and a thumb.

That’s just the tip of the iceberg. The Play Guide gives ideas on how to use the playthings, as well as immediately usable activities, tips, and bite-sized developmental information.
