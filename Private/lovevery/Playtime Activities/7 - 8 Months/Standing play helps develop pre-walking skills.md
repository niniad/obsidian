Most babies start pulling up to a [standing](https://blog.lovevery.com/skills-stages/standing/) position between 6 and 10 months. They may pull up using a table leg, couch, low table, or even your clothes. Once your child is upright, you may see a lot of gentle bouncing and knee-bending, which get them used to being on their feet and support hip, leg, and core development.

To help your baby practice this new skill, move objects and activities off the floor and onto sturdy low furniture such as couches, chairs, and tables. Standing play helps them develop the strength and balance they’ll need for [walking](https://blog.lovevery.com/skills-stages/walking/).

## Standing play ideas

1. **If your sofa has removable cushions, take them off** so your baby can reach and pull up on the frame of the couch.
2. **Place favorite objects on a low table or couch** within view to give your baby an incentive to pull up to a standing position.
3. **Put large, baby-safe magnets on your refrigerator** at your child’s standing height.
4. **Tape a large piece of paper to the wall and give your baby stickers** to adhere to it.
5. **Place sticky notes on a wall at a level that requires your child to stand** **to reach them**; babies love pulling sticky notes off of surfaces.

*Note: Please supervise your baby at all times during these activities to ensure they do not mouth stickers and sticky notes. Small items like these could become choking hazards, so put them safely away when play is done.*

## Tips for lowering back down

Between 9 and 10 months, many babies start to practice lowering back to a seated position from supported standing. In this transitional period, some babies may be uncertain about how to get back down to the floor. If they need help, here are some things to try:

1. **Put a couple large pillows on the floor behind your baby** during standing play so they don’t have to lower themselves down as far.
2. **While they’re standing, place a [toy](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits) on the floor** to encourage your baby to squat down. If they seem to need help, you can assist them in lowering to a squat, and then down to sitting.
3. **Try to let them find their own solution** before you come to the rescue. They may just plop back onto their bottom and try again.
