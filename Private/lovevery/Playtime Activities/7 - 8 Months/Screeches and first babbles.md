# Screeches and first babbles

Source: https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/screeches-and-first-babbles/

If your baby hasn’t yet, they will soon discover their own voice and all the funny and loud sounds they can make. Many babies start to babble “baba-baba” around 6 months.

One of the best things you can do for your baby’s development right now is to tune into their vocalizations, let them talk, and then have a “conversation,” making space for your baby to respond.

### My baby is making so much noise when we are supposed to be quiet!

As embarrassing as your baby’s sounds can be when you’re on the plane, in church, or somewhere where everyone else is quiet, find soft verbal and non-verbal ways to acknowledge your baby’s vocalizations by talking, touching, smiling, and looking at their face.

### But my baby is screeching so loudly!

If your baby is making loud screechy noises (most babies start to do this between 6 ½ and 8 months), know that this is totally normal. Child development professionals actually refer to this as an important cognitive stage: your baby is learning that they have a voice and that adults will respond to it.

The most important thing to know is that [responding to your baby’s sounds](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/what-is-serve-and-return-and-why-is-it-so-important/) (even if they are screechy) will make it rewarding for them to keep developing their language. Soon, the screeches will turn into words 😉
