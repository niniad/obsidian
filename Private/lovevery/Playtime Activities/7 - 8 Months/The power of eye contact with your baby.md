Gazing into your baby’s eyes isn’t just important for building an emotional connection. Research suggests that it can also have a powerful effect on early communication and learning.

A study conducted in the Baby-LINC Lab at the University of Cambridge found that when an adult and baby gaze into each other’s eyes, their brain waves synchronize ❤️ In the study, when the adult made direct eye contact, the babies made more vocalizations.

Researchers suspect that when you look at your baby, you send a signal to their brain that you’re tuned in and receptive to hearing what they have to say. This makes them more likely to [communicate with you](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/6-tips-for-how-to-talk-to-someone-who-doesnt-yet-talk-back/) through their voice, eyes, or gestures.

As simple as eye contact seems, it can positively impact [your baby’s brain](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/what-is-my-babys-brain-working-on-at-11-weeks-old/) and pave the way for deeper learning.
