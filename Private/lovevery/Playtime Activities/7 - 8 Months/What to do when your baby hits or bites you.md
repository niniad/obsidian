It’s hard not to worry when your baby pulls your hair or bites you, but they aren’t being malicious. At this age, they don’t yet understand that they’re hurting you.

Right now, this kind of physical behavior is experimental and a form of play. When your baby grabs a handful of your hair and yanks it, they likely do it to see how you’ll react or because they love interacting with you ❤️

## What should you do when your baby hurts you?

### Keep your expectations in check

Teaching your baby how their behavior affects others is going to take time. A single “no”—or even 50—may not get them to stop squeezing, hitting, biting, or pulling at this stage. Gaining control over their impulses is a process that happens over the course of years and will require a lot of practice and guidance.

### Avoid a big reaction

Babies like seeing what happens when they do something, so a strong reaction may encourage them to try again. Instead, use a firm, neutral voice to say “ouch” or “no.” For example, if they grab your face and squeeze, gently remove their hand and say “Ouch! Squeezing hurts. I can’t let you do that. Let’s have a hug instead.”

### Use positive redirection

In addition to saying “no” or “ouch,” offer your baby an alternative that meets their needs: “Ouch. Biting feels so good for your teeth, but biting hurts me. Here’s something safe for you to chew.”

If the behavior doesn’t stop, you can try stepping outside, bringing them to a different room, or even moving from the couch to the floor. A change of scenery may help refocus their attention and disrupt their behavior pattern. At this age, your baby isn’t old enough to understand consequences—this isn’t a “time out,” just a small switch to help them move on.
