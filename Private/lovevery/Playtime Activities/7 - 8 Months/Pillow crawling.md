Climb that mountain, baby! If you have a crawler (on average around 8-10 months) that needs more of a challenge, try creating a mountain of pillows. This activity is also really great for babies who have skipped crawling or are quickly trying to move past the crawling stage.⁣

So why are we encouraging you to keep your baby crawling? [Crawling](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/helping-your-baby-crawl-and-why-its-important-to-keep-them-crawling/) offers a lot of important benefits! It strengthens your baby’s core, shoulders, and hand muscles. It gives your little one the opportunity to practice their coordination and balance while both sides of their body are moving differently. And it also [promotes the left and right brain](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/why_crawl) to communicate with each other which enhances learning. Crawling is also a foundational skill that is needed when they learn to walk, run and jump!
