Babies love to play with real household objects, especially ones they see you use 🙂

Try putting together a basket of baby-safe items from the rooms where you often spend time, like the bathroom and kitchen.

* Some bathroom ideas include hair brushes, curlers, combs, and clean toothbrushes, and plastic or wooden bracelets you no longer wear.
* In the kitchen, you could include muffin tins, whisks, pastry brushes, plastic containers, plastic plates or cups, pans and lids, measuring spoons, dish towels, and oven mitts.

Note: Watch your baby closely to make sure they don’t put small objects in their mouth. Always supervise your baby around objects with handles, like whisks, brushes, and wooden spoons.
