Playdates don’t always go as planned, whether they’re with cousins, neighbors, or friends. There can be [conflicts over toys](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/is-your-toddler-ready-to-take-turns-and-share/)—or the children may seem to have no interest in [playing together](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/social-play-for-toddlers/) at all 🙃 These aren’t necessarily bad things. In fact, they’re part of how your 2-year-old learns the social and emotional skills needed to become a friend.

## How to set your toddler—and their playmates—up for success

### 1. Prepare your child

The morning of your playdate, let your child know who is coming over and at what time of the day. If you have a special activity or snack planned, your toddler can help you get it ready.

### 2. Get in front of toy conflicts

* **Tuck away special toys.** Put away any new toys or extra special ones. Two-year-olds might struggle seeing someone else play with their favorite playthings.
* **Put out toys in multiples.** For example, if you happen to have multiple toy cars or trucks, put them all out rather than just one.
* **Help them take turns.** If a conflict arises, you can say, “It will be your turn to play with the truck when your friend is finished. What could we do while you wait?”

### 3. Simplify your expectations

At this age, many children still spend most of their time playing by themselves or playing near others but not with them. And that’s okay. If they don’t play together this time, they may be more interested at their next playdate.

## 3 simple activities that encourage children to play together

Activities that encourage playing side by side can help your child and their friend connect. Here are a few ideas:

* Put out the **[Race & Chase Ramp](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-adventurer)** from **The Adventurer Play Kit**. The two ramps encourage using it together, taking turns, or even timing the cars to go down simultaneously.
