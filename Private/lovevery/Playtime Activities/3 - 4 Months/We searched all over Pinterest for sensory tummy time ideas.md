Babies crave a lot of exposure to different sights, sounds, and textures, so try mixing up tummy time with sensory play. We gathered a few quick ideas from Pinterest.

* Float the [Wobbler](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-senser) or some balls in a pan of water on the floor. Please supervise closely at all times and use as little water as possible for this activity. Drowning can occur in as little as one inch of water.
