During your baby’s first few months they are soaking up the world around them. They will enjoy looking at contrasting images, soothing lights, windows and blinds. Around 5 months your baby’s color vision will improve, they can begin to see in three dimensions, and perceive whether something is near or far away.

A fun and easy activity to stimulate your baby’s eyes is to set up a starry sky for them to gaze up at! You will find they may be mesmerized by the soft lights. ✨

**What you’ll need:**

* A cardboard box
* String Lights
* Knife or scissors

Using a sharp tool poke holes into the side of a cardboard box large enough to lay your baby in. Poke the lights through the holes and plug them in to create a dreamy scene for your little one to get lost in.

Please don’t leave your baby unattended with the box or lights, and be sure to unplug the lights when play is over.
