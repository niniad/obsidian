Source: https://blog.lovevery.com/product-recommendations/welcome-to-the-charmer-play-kit-for-months-3-4/

Great news: your [Play Kit](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-charmer) is only days away from appearing on your doorstep. Just in time, too—your charming baby has grown so much in just two short months. Chances are you’ve started to see real smiles, more head control, and a better ability to recognize people from further away; and if not, know those are coming. The next two months have so much in store for you and your baby both, and that’s where The Charmer Play Kit comes in.

Your baby explores the world with their hands and mouth, and the Charmer is all about multi-sensory experiences. From the Soft Book—with its crinkles, soft pages, and variety of textures—to the Rolling Bell’s enticing sounds and movement, and everything in between, all items in the box are precisely designed with your baby’s development in mind.

In addition to the playthings and activities, check out the Play Guide that comes with The Charmer: it’s chock-full of developmental information, activity ideas, and suggestions for supporting your baby’s play.
