*The four new Course Packs—Potty Learning, New Sibling, Food Before 1, and Tummy Time—provide child development expert insight*.

Parenthood is filled with questions. Lovevery’s Parent Courses bring answers: with practical, hands-on tips for your most common parenting challenges in the first year.

### **Informed parenting with answers from our experts**

We love bringing you fast facts and tips at your fingertips with social media and our blog. We heard from our community that you wanted more: more information you can trust from our thoughtful team of experts.

Our Parent Courses give you the chance to dig in a bit deeper to early childhood development topics like tummy time and food before one.

### **Designed for busy parents**

We know you’re busy, so we broke the Courses down into brief videos that you can watch at your own pace, in any order. Once you sign up, you can come back to the Courses for six months. We also include a Parent Course Guide that’s yours to keep for easy reference to tips and course content.

### **Less stress, more connection**

We hope you walk away from these Courses more excited and less worried about your child’s early development. You know your child better than anyone. By listening to your natural intuition—and having a toolkit of practical, science-backed tips—you’ll feel more informed and more connected to your child during this special time.

We’re here for you every step of the way.

**As a Play Kit subscriber, you have free access to the Course Pack expert videos in The Lovevery App**.
