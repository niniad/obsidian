After cooing and smiling, [laughing](https://blog.lovevery.com/skills-stages/laughing/) comes next. Between 3 and 4 months of age, your baby will likely giggle for the first time. Laughing happens when babies can combine a vocalization with a social, or purposeful, smile.

At this age, your baby doesn’t laugh because they think something is funny—they don’t experience humor the way adults do. Your baby laughs because of something new or unexpected, or because they are mimicking you 😉

## Gentle fun can get your baby laughing

To encourage that first giggle, try playing peekaboo. At this age, your baby doesn’t understand that you’re still there when they can’t see you. So when you hide your face and reveal it again, they’re delighted by the surprise.

Tickling, rubbing noses, blowing raspberries, and laughing yourself may also elicit a laugh. Making funny faces while [looking in a mirror together](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/who-is-that-cutie-in-the-mirror/) might also make them giggle. The key is to make eye contact and connect with your baby in fun, gentle ways. With a little experimentation, you’ll discover what your baby likes.

### Choose the right time

To encourage your baby’s laughter, it’s best to save your efforts for when they’re comfortable and well rested. Their smile and [eye contact](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/how-eye-contact-affects-your-babys-brain-development/) tell you when you’re on the right track. If they turn away or are upset by your playful behavior, shift to a less stimulating interaction, such as cuddling, to help them recover. You’ll have plenty of opportunities to catch that first giggle in the days ahead ❤️
