These beautiful mini bouquets are fun natural paintbrushes!

Go for a nature walk and collect some “paintbrushes”. Leaves, flowers, pinecones, branches. Gather what Mother Nature offered and wrap it all together with a rubber band. Let your child examine, feel, and smell, their new art materials.

Then tape down some paper, grab some [paint](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/sensory-play-and-why-letting-your-baby-get-messy-is-important/), and let them see what lines and patterns the natural bundles make!

Happy painting!
