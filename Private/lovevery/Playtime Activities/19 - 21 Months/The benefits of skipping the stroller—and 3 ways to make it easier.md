A stroller can be a convenient tool when it’s time to drop off a sibling at school, run errands, or rush through the airport. But as your toddler gets steadier on their feet, an occasional adventure out of the stroller can support their development in multiple ways:

* **Better balance and coordination**. Different surfaces, like gravel, grass, or an angled ramp, provide new challenges.
* **Satisfied curiosity**. Your toddler gets a broader and deeper view of the world, from the tiniest ant on the sidewalk to the pointy top of a tall building, when they’re free to explore.
* **Heightened confidence**. When your toddler successfully tackles a new challenge, like climbing the stairs to the library doors, they gain the confidence to persist on future obstacles, too.

Your toddler doesn’t yet have the impulse control needed to stop themselves from running into a busy street. Their safety comes first, so be sure that you can give them your full attention and [react quickly](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/why-to-stop-saying-be-careful-and-what-to-say-instead/).

## 3 simple strategies to take a break from the stroller

### Walk the last block

Let your toddler out of the stroller for the last block—even half a block—of a longer expedition. Five minutes may not seem like much, but it’s long enough for your toddler to examine a fire hydrant or climb over some tree roots. They may not want to go back in the stroller once they’re out, so a “last-block walk” could work better than starting stroller-free.

### Let fences (or walls) do some of the work

Keep your active toddler in sight by visiting a fenced-in park or other area, like a school playground or sports field. And indoor spaces like your local children’s museum, aquarium, conservatory, or toddler-friendly library can be an adventure in any weather. Many of these places have children-centered areas with a single entrance for safety.

### Wander the neighborhood

Rather than a 20-minute walk in the stroller, try heading out the door for 20 minutes on foot. Because you’re close to home, you can leave the diaper bag and extras behind and see where your toddler takes you. They may surprise you at how fast they run or how slowly they explore. Don’t be surprised if you spend all 20 minutes in the driveway 🙃
