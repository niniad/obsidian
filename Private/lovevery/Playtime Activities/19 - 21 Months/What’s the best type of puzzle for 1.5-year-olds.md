Toddlers love to figure out how things fit together. Puzzle play is a great way for them to learn how to orient objects and predict which shapes might fit into a particular space. Even the simplest puzzles can build both short-term memory and spatial awareness.

At 1 ½, your toddler may be ready for puzzles with a variety of shapes, like geometric or animal. They may start by matching shapes oriented in the same direction. When you present the pieces of the [Geo Shapes Puzzle](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-realist), lay out just the largest pieces and align them with their spots in the base. That way, your child can more easily make the visual comparison between the puzzle piece and its place on the board.

Once your toddler can complete the puzzle with the largest pieces oriented for them, switch it up and rotate the square and triangle pieces so they’re at a different angle. Selecting the right piece will require an extra step of mental rotation. When they’re ready, add in the next layer of challenge by including the nesting pieces of the puzzle.

## What puzzle skills will your toddler be ready for next?

Closer to age 2, your toddler may be ready for simple, oversized jigsaw puzzles. The [Chunky Wooden Jigsaw Puzzle](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-companion) allows them to practice fitting more complex shapes together. Once your toddler can complete it, they’ll be ready to move on to floor puzzles, which engage the whole body in fun, new ways.
