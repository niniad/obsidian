Have you ever seen your toddler cry, hide, or even appear not to notice when they see another person hurt or upset? It’s easy to believe that this is because they don’t care, but research shows that toddlers can—and often do—feel empathy when others are in distress. Sometimes their own feelings of discomfort or fear get in the way of showing it.

[Pretend play](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/4-types-of-pretend-play-and-why-they-matter/) is one way to help your toddler learn to manage their own emotions and practice responding with compassion. They still might freeze or need your support when a person is truly hurt or sad. But acting out simple real-life situations during play can give them a chance to learn about other people’s feelings without their own distress getting in the way.

## 3 steps for using pretend play to practice empathy

### Step 1: Choose a familiar scenario

Your toddler will be more likely to relate to a situation that they’ve recently experienced. Keep it simple so they can follow along as you play. Think of a situation that is only mildly upsetting to your toddler, like when they get water in their eyes during a bath.

### Step 2: Practice with a favorite doll or stuffed animal

Gather a washcloth, an empty bowl, and a [baby doll](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-thinker), and take turns “washing” the baby. Pretend to pour a bit of water in the doll’s eyes as you wash their hair. When the baby “cries,” model how to respond: “Oh, no! The baby is sad. What should we do?” Show your toddler how to wipe the doll’s eyes and give them a comforting hug. Next time, your toddler might have their own ideas for consoling the baby.

### Step 3: Point out how your toddler can make a difference

Just as you would in real life, let your toddler know how their comfort and care had a positive impact. “Baby was so sad when water got in his eyes, but we helped him feel better. It feels good to help.”
