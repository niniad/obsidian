Giving your child opportunities to focus on a task uninterrupted and get into a “zone of concentration” is an important part of the Montessori approach. The amount of time your 1-year-old spends in this focused state will likely be quite short now (only a few minutes at a time) but it will grow as they practice and gain stamina.

Try these research- and expert-backed ideas to help your toddler concentrate.

## Prepare the environment

Try to minimize sensory inputs by turning off screens, eliminating background noise, or moving to a quiet room.

## Let your child take the lead

Your toddler is more likely to stay focused on an activity or plaything that they choose. One-year-olds may want to [fill up containers](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/collecting-and-transporting/) and dump them out, or work on [poking small objects through small holes](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/5-ways-for-your-toddler-to-play-with-small-objects/).

## Stay quiet

Resist the urge to interrupt or comment when you see your toddler focused intently on something. This is not a moment for narration. If they look up at you, acknowledge them with a smile.

## Practice joint attention

[Focusing on a toy or activity with your toddler](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/wish-your-toddler-would-focus-try-playing-together-first/), even briefly, can help them pay attention longer. Research shows that even a few minutes of engaging with a plaything together—even if no words are spoken—makes it more likely your toddler will continue playing with their [toy](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits) on their own.

## Offer ‘just right’ tasks and set up intentional activities

Aim to give your 1-year-old tasks that are just a little challenging for them, like [stacking rings onto a peg](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/introducing-the-wooden-stacking-pegboard-the-montessori-way/) or peeling strips of painter’s tape off the wall. When a task is too easy, they can become bored; if it’s too hard, they may become overly frustrated and give up. It’s a tricky balance to get right ❤️

## Let them struggle some

A little bit of frustration can be good for your toddler, even if it’s hard to watch sometimes. Allowing them to struggle with a task gives them a chance to complete it on their own. This gives them a feeling of pride and makes it far more likely that they’ll try again.
