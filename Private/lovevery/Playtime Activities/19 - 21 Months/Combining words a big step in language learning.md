If your toddler seems to be adding words to their vocabulary by the day, they may be on the verge of using two-word phrases. Most toddlers start to combine words by age 2, but some begin as early as 15 months.

Your toddler may be ready to use two-word phrases if they:

* Say 50 words or more—word approximations, like “wa-wa” for water, count, too ❤️
* Use different types of words, like nouns (“truck”), verbs (“go”), and adjectives (“big”).
* Combine words and gestures to add meaning—for example, they may say “bus” and extend their arms wide to show that it’s big.

## What counts as a two-word phrase?

Whenever your toddler combines two words with distinct meanings—“more banana” or “done water”—they’re using a two-word phrase. They need to understand that the two words are different for it to count. By contrast, your toddler may interpret some phrases that they hear all the time—like “all done” or “I love you”—as one unit with a single meaning. Eventually, they’ll learn that these common phrases are made up of individual words and begin using those words in new combinations: “I love Dada” or “I love cheese.”

## How to encourage two-word phrases

The simplest way to help your toddler start combining words is to model and repeat two-word phrases.

**Use high-impact phrases.** Try saying, “Light on,” when you turn the light on and “Light off” when you turn it off. Two-word pairings like this can be powerful—“light” stays the same, but “on” and “off” make opposite things happen.

**Follow a longer sentence with a two-word phrase.** “Do you want more to eat? More avocado?” Your toddler is more likely to notice and repeat the two-word phrase if you end your statement with it.

**Add a word to what your toddler says to you.** If your toddler says, “Dog!” respond with, “Oh, a dog. Big dog!”

**Put your toddler’s gestures into words.** Before toddlers put two spoken words together, they often pair a single word with a meaningful gesture. Help your toddler move from gesture-word pairs to two-word phrases by putting the gesture into the phrase for them. If your toddler points to a speeding car and says, “Fast!” respond with, “Fast car!” If they reach up their arms and say whatever name they call you—like “Mama” or “Baba”—you can say, “Baba up? Okay. Baba up!” as you lift them.

**Make it meaningful.** Your toddler is more likely to use two-word phrases that help them get their needs met. Here are some examples:

“More water”

“Done milk”

“Up, Dada”

“Mama help”

“Read book”

“Wash hands”

“Go outside”

“Open door”

“Shoes on”
