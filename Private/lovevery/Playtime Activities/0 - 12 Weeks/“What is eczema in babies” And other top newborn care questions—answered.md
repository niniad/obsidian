As a new parent, it’s natural to have a lot of questions about caring for your baby. What’s causing their eczema? Why do their poops look green? Lovevery’s team of experts can help you navigate these common parenting concerns with practical tips and evidence-based advice.

## Parents ask:

*“What causes eczema? Is it a sign of allergies?”*

#### Lovevery experts answer:

Eczema is a common skin condition that causes red, itchy, and dry patches on the skin. The exact cause isn’t fully understood, but multiple factors—such as genetics and environmental elements—can contribute to its development.

In babies, eczema may occur if their skin doesn’t have enough of a certain protein to maintain a strong barrier, causing it to lose moisture more quickly. Dry skin can make babies more sensitive to triggers like pet dander, dust mites, soaps, and detergents. While allergies don’t directly cause eczema, they can sometimes make symptoms worse.

Eczema in babies often appears as a rash on the cheeks and around the mouth, which can be exacerbated by drooling. If your baby has the condition, check with their pediatrician or a pediatric dermatologist for ointment recommendations—most are available over the counter.

## Parents ask:

*“What’s the best way to bathe a newborn and how often should I do it?”*

#### Lovevery experts answer:

Bathing your tiny newborn may feel nerve-wracking at first, but with practice, you’ll feel more comfortable. Remember, your baby is adjusting to their [new environment](https://blog.lovevery.com/parent-family-life/expert-advice-for-the-first-few-weeks-with-your-newborn/) outside the womb. Slowly introduce the feel of water or a sponge to their skin and give them time to adjust to all the new sensations.

In the beginning, your newborn doesn’t need a full bath. Sponge baths are best until their umbilical cord stump falls off. Once it does, you can wash your baby in a baby bathtub, paying close attention to skin folds around their neck and diaper area. Here are a few tips:

* Always apply a gentle baby lotion immediately after their bath to lock in moisture.
* Bathing your newborn every day can strip their skin of natural oils. In the early weeks, try bathing them every few days. If their skin doesn’t become too dry, you can start bathing them every other day.
* If your baby’s skin appears dry, consider using soap only every few washes and plain water the rest of the time.

Please supervise your baby at all times around water, as it is possible for them to drown in less than an inch of water. It’s an excellent idea for you and any other caregivers to complete training in baby CPR and first aid by a certified instructor. In the event of a drowning event, call 911 (or your local counterpart) immediately, as seconds count when it comes to avoiding death or serious brain injury.

## Parents ask:

*“When should my baby’s umbilical cord fall off?”*

#### Lovevery experts answer:

The umbilical cord stump typically falls off 1 to 3 weeks after birth. During the first week, it may start to dry out and turn dark brown or black, and you may see some dried blood where it attaches to your baby’s belly. This is all part of the normal healing process.

Over the next week or two, the umbilical cord stump will continue to dry and shrink. The most important thing is to keep it clean and free of moisture. Fold down the front of your baby’s diaper so it doesn’t rub against the stump. Avoid pulling or trying to remove it—the stump will fall off naturally in time.

If you’re concerned about how the umbilical cord stump is healing or see any signs of infection like swelling, redness, or pus, immediately contact your baby’s pediatrician for evaluation.

## Parents ask:

*“My baby’s poop is slightly green. Should I be worried?”*

#### Lovevery experts answer:

In most cases, green poop isn’t a cause for concern if your baby is feeding well, gaining weight, and has no digestive problems. Healthy newborn poop can vary in color, from greenish to yellow or brown. In the first few days after birth, your baby will pass meconium—a thick, dark green or black substance. Once they start feeding, their poop will change in color and consistency, though it may still appear greenish.

As your baby matures and continues feeding, green poop may occur for other reasons. For breastfed babies, it can sometimes result from a foremilk-hindmilk imbalance. Foremilk, which comes at the beginning of a feeding, is more watery, while the hindmilk that follows is fattier. The composition of the milk depends on the length of time between feedings and how much milk is drained from the breast each time. If your baby gets more foremilk, they digest it faster, which may cause greenish poops.

If you’re breastfeeding, changes in your diet can also result in green poop. For formula-fed babies, the amount of iron in the formula may give your baby’s poop a greenish hue. As your baby grows and starts solid foods, their poop will continue to change in color, texture, and odor.
