Have you noticed that your baby prefers to turn their head to one side? Head turning preferences are very common during the newborn phase. Your baby may have an inclination to turn to one side due to the way they were curled up in the womb.

If you see your baby favoring one side over the other, encourage them to turn their head to the opposite direction during floor play, tummy time, and when holding them. These kinds of exercises can prevent torticollis (tightness of the neck muscles) and flat spots on their head.

**Activities that can help:**

* Shake the **[Silicone Rattle](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker)** or capture their attention with a **[Simple Black & White Card](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker)** on their less-preferred side.
* Your baby is likely to turn toward light and activity, so alternate the direction they are facing in their crib or on their changing table.
* Only use baby swings, seats, and recliners in moderation so your baby can spend more time in unrestricted play positions.

**When to get help**

If there are changes to your baby’s head shape or they still have a strong positional preference after a few weeks of these exercises, consider approaching your pediatrician to see if gentle therapy could help.
