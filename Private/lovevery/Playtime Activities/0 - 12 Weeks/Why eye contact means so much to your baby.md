Most babies begin to make regular eye contact during the first 8 weeks of life. This visual connection is a critical **building block for communication and language development**. It also strengthens the bond between you ❤️

1. Encourage eye contact when your baby is calm and content.
2. Hold them 8 to 12 inches from your face to give them the clearest view.
3. As you look into each other’s eyes, try singing to them or telling them a story.
4. Make eye contact with your baby as much as possible throughout the day.
