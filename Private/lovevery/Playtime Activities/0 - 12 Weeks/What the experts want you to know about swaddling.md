Swaddling can keep your baby from getting overstimulated by their own jerky limbs—known as the startle reflex—but if your baby is content without swaddling, you don’t have to do it. There is nothing that says babies *have* to be swaddled.

## If you decide to swaddle, here are some expert tips to keep it safe and healthy for your baby’s development:

* Swaddling should only be used for sleeping or to calm a fussy baby; babies also need plenty of time on the floor to move all of their limbs freely
* Focus the snug portion of the swaddle on your baby’s arms (their legs and hips need room to move)
* Some babies like to be swaddled in a way that lets them access their hands
* Use lightweight fabrics like muslin so your baby doesn’t get too warm
* Make sure the top of the blanket is away from their face
* Make sure your baby’s chest can expand when breathing; this might sound obvious, but it’s important to make sure the swaddle isn’t too snug
* The American Academy of Pediatrics says to stop swaddling as soon as your baby shows signs of rolling, which can happen as early as 2 to 3 months. If you see your baby reach for their feet when on their back, roll from their back to their side, or turn their face toward the floor when on their side, it’s time to stop swaddling.

Note: Be sure to put your baby on their back and on a flat surface for sleeping (instead of in a swing or baby seat). It is so important for development.
