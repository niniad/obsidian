It can be hard to find time for skin-to-skin contact with your baby, but research shows even a small amount can offer significant benefits, particularly for preemies and babies delivered via C-section. Experts recommend trying for an hour at a time; if that isn’t possible, shorter sessions can be very therapeutic.

## 8 benefits of skin-to-skin time

Skin-to-skin time with your baby can:

1. Accelerate your baby’s brain development
2. Help their digestive system mature
3. Regulate their body temperature
4. Improve the duration and quality of their sleep
5. Promote their weight gain
6. Boost their immune system
7. Stimulate calming hormones (for both baby and you)
8. Boost a mother’s milk supply

## Tips for maximizing skin-to-skin time with your baby

### Make it part of your daily routine

Doing skin-to-skin at the same time each day could help it become a natural part of your routine. Try it after your baby’s morning feeding or in the evening before bed, for example. Before you get settled, use the bathroom and get some water, a book, and anything else you’d like to have handy. Take off your shirt, strip your baby down to their diaper, and find a comfortable chair. Place your newborn on your chest, so their bare skin is against yours. Use a cozy blanket to cover you both.

### Take a bath together

Once your baby’s umbilical cord stump has fallen off, a soothing bath can be a great way to log some skin-to-skin time, provided the air temperature is warm enough. Before climbing in, place towels within reach and check the water temperature with a thermometer to ensure that it’s no warmer than 100° F (38° C). Don’t step in while holding your baby. Place them in a bassinet beside the tub and get situated in the bath before lifting them in or having someone hand them to you. Use the same strategy to exit the tub.

### Give your baby a massage

As long as your baby enjoys it, lightly smoothing a baby-safe oil such as coconut on them with your hands is another excellent skin-to-skin option. For the most calming effect, place them on a towel (use an older one, as sometimes oils can leave stains) and work from the center of their body out. For example, you might start with your baby’s chest and move outward to their arms and legs. Don’t worry about doing it perfectly; your gentle, loving touch is what matters most.

### Make tummy time do double duty

Turn tummy time into a skin-to-skin activity: strip your baby down to their diaper and remove your shirt, then lie down in a comfortable spot (such as your bed) with them on your chest. This gives them the benefits of being on their tummy and in contact with you all at once. This works best if your baby has been fed due to their rooting reflex.

Skin-to-skin time provides a multitude of benefits regardless of who is making contact with your baby: mom, dad, caregivers, or even supervised siblings.
