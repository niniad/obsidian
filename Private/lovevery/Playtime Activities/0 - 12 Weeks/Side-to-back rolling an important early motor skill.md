Between 6 and 8 weeks, many babies learn to roll from their side to their back. You can encourage your baby to practice this new skill:

* Place them on their side on the floor.
* Hold a black and white object eight to 12 inches from your baby’s face.
* Slowly move the object up to get them to follow it with their eyes.
* Then, move it behind your baby until they roll onto their back.
* Repeat a few times, then do the activity with your baby lying on their other side.
