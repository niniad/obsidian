Tummy time builds the muscles and coordination needed for rolling over, crawling, reaching, and playing. If your baby seems to be getting tired or starts crying, it’s time for a break.

## Check out these ideas for how to do tummy time if your baby isn’t loving the floor:

### Tummy time on a table

Closely supervise your baby (with a hand on their back or very close by) doing tummy time on the counter or table. They might be more willing if you are face-to-face and they get a different view of the room.

### On your chest

Put your baby on your chest on their tummy, facing you, and softly talk to them to try to encourage them to lift their head. By two and a half months, your baby will likely be able to lift their head up enough so that they can see a little ahead of them (but not yet straight ahead).

### On your thighs

Put your baby on your thighs, belly-down, and gently rub their back. If you raise one of your legs higher than the other, they will be able to see a little more. Show them a [high-contrast image](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-charmer) and slowly move it upward to encourage them to lift their head.

### Use an exercise ball

Try gently rolling your baby back and forth on an exercise ball. You may need to give it a couple of tries, as this kind of movement is a new feeling for your baby!
