There’s often a lot of excitement when your baby learns a new major skill, like rolling over, sitting up, or saying their first word. But to get there, they first need to develop a series of more subtle **micro skills**.

When your baby lifts their head in tummy time or brings their hands together in front of their body, they’re preparing for bigger, more complex movements. Even catching your eye for a moment is a micro skill that leads to more advanced forms of communication. Here’s how to notice and support the small moments on the way to major developmental achievements:

## Key skills your baby may be working on now

### Milestone: Head control

At some point, you’ll be able to hold your baby on your hip without supporting their head. It takes time. Most babies don’t have the strength to hold their head steady when they’re held upright until about 3 or 4 months of age. But they’re already laying the groundwork with these micro skills:

**Micro skill #1. Turning their head fully to each side as they lie on their back.** Many babies prefer to turn their head to one side or the other. Through play, you can encourage your baby to stretch and strengthen their neck muscles to promote balanced physical development and motor skills. Try putting the [Standing Card Holder](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker)with a [Black & White Card](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker) on your baby’s preferred side. Then, move it to their other side, encouraging them to turn and look the other way. You can also gently turn their head for them and let them rest in that position, gazing at the card.

**Micro skill #2. Holding their head centered while on their back.** Keeping their heavy head from tilting to one side or the other requires neck strength. Entice your baby to look straight up by placing them directly under [The Mobile](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker) with the black-and-white side facing down.

**Micro skill #3. Lifting their head and keeping it centered in tummy time.** While your baby may be lifting their head at an angle, lifting and holding it centered is a bigger challenge. To encourage them, lean back in a comfortable spot with your baby tummy down on your chest. They’ll be motivated to lift their head to see your face as you smile, sing, and chat with them.

### Milestone: Grasping a toy

Your baby may grip your finger or a toy when you put it in their hand—that’s their grasping reflex at work. Around 4 to 6 months, they’ll be able to intentionally grasp a toy by coordinating what they see with their reaching hand and fingers. Until then, keep an eye out for these micro skills:

**Micro skill #1. Looking at their extended hand while lying on their back.** Before your baby can reach with intention, they first need to know they have hands and arms 🙃Usually, they start to notice their own hands around 6 to 8 weeks. Because your baby still focuses best on high-contrast points—like black-and-white images—use the [Black & White Mittens](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker)to encourage them to spot their hands as they reflexively move them.

**Micro skill #2. Bringing their hands together and to their mouth.** Your baby’s first toy is their own body, as they figure out how it works and what it can do. Bringing their hands together and to their mouth is one way that they discover and learn. Try placing the[Silicone Rattle](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker) into your baby’s hands to encourage them to use a two-fisted grip and bring the rattle toward their mouth.

**Micro skill #3. Swinging their arm toward a toy and touching it.** Around 3 or 4 months, your baby may start to swing their arm to touch an object, though they may not be able to grasp onto it just yet. Try hanging the [Sensory Links](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker) in[The Play Gym](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-gym)and place your baby underneath. As your baby lies on the mat, watch to see if they reach for or bat at the links. If they don’t within a few minutes, you can shake the links to encourage them.

### Milestone: Babbling

From birth, babies experiment with making different sounds and noises. Over time, they develop more complex vocalizations, including cooing, gurgling, and, eventually, babbling. Those first “ma-ma-ma” or “pa-pa-pa” repetitions—specifically known as “canonical babbling”—usually start between 5 and 9 months. Here are some micro skills your baby is working on now to get them ready to talk:

**Micro skill #1. Making eye contact and studying your face.** Tuning into social information, like watching your face and listening to your voice, are the very first ways your baby learns about communication and language. At birth, your baby can’t focus on your facial features, but their vision will sharpen over the next few months and you’ll notice more moments of eye contact. Give them plenty of opportunities to gaze at your face during feedings, diaper changes, and other everyday moments—and be sure to gaze back and smile as much as possible.

**Micro skill #2. Responding to changes in your facial expressions or sounds.** Talking to your baby creates and reinforces neural connections for the sounds they hear. In fact, their first “babbles” are based on the languages they’re already learning at just 1 month of age. Behavior changes, like kicks, squeals, or even a little smile, are signs they notice your sounds and facial expressions. Try reading the [Wooden Book](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker) in a reclined position with your baby propped on your thighs. This will allow them to see your face as you talk.

**Micro skill #3. Cooing vowel sounds.** Your baby’s first coos can be just as exciting as their first babbles. While you may hear grunts and squeaks in the first months, most babies begin cooing vowel sounds around 3 months or later. Encourage them to keep going by responding to their sounds with the same sound—like, “Ooooo, ooooo, ooooo.”
