# Welcome to The Looker Play Kit for Weeks 0-12

Source: https://blog.lovevery.com/product-recommendations/welcome-to-the-looker-play-kit-for-weeks-0-12/

Each plaything in [The Looker](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker) is especially designed for your newborn, who is experiencing the sights, sounds, and sensations of the outside world for the very first time ❤️

Your baby can see about 8-14 inches from their face, and they view the world in shades of black, white, and gray. That’s why this first Play Kit features high contrast, black and white objects. Images your baby can distinguish from the blurriness of the world around them are helpful as their eyes begin to work together, focus, adjust to light, and process color.

The Play Guide that comes with The Looker has step-by-step instructions and suggestions for how to use the playthings in the box. It starts with a specific developmental snapshot, including the motor, cognitive, and language skills your newborn is already hard at work to build. We’ve also included some activities for daily life, including suggestions for baby massages, tummy time, and skin-to-skin bonding.
