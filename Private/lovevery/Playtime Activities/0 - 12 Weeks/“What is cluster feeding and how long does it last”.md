## Parents ask:

*“What is cluster feeding and how long will it last?”*

#### Lovevery expert answer:

Cluster feeding is when your baby’s feedings are more closely spaced together than usual. When your baby is in this phase, they may show signs of being hungry only 30 to 60 minutes after their last feeding. **It can literally feel like you’re feeding them *constantly*.**

Cluster feeding most commonly happens around weeks 2 and 6 of a baby’s life and tends to be most intense in the evenings. It can also occur again around months 3 and 6.

Experts think cluster feeding is associated with growth spurts. Your baby may nurse more during these times of growth to increase your milk production, so you can keep up with their growing nutritional needs. The more your baby nurses, the more milk you’re able to produce.

**Cluster feeding usually only lasts for a few days, but it can feel overwhelming.** During this time, be sure to care for your physical and emotional needs as best you can. Keep plenty of healthy snacks and water nearby when you breastfeed to help meet your added nutritional needs. Rest when you can. Allow your partner, friends, and family to help care for the baby when you aren’t breastfeeding.

Keep in mind that this phase won’t last forever and soon your baby will return to a more typical feeding pattern ❤️
