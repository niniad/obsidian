You know your baby needs tummy time, but sometimes they seem so uncomfortable. You may wonder, “Are we doing this right?” 🙃

Tummy time positions actually vary quite a bit depending on your baby’s age and strength. Comfort is the goal when they’re first starting out, followed by strengthening and, eventually, forward movement.

Learn what to expect over time in this illustrated guide from pediatric occupational therapist Rachel Coley. For more, check out the Lovevery Parent Course, [The Tummy Time Course Pack](https://lovevery.com/products/the-tummy-time-course-pack).

## Tummy time at 6–10 months

At this stage, the goal for your baby is movement. Your older baby may:

![Tummy time at 6-10 months](https://i0.wp.com/blog.lovevery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/US-I-Blog-I-Tummy-Time-Stages-10-copy.webp?resize=1000%2C617&ssl=1)

* Belly [crawl](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/helping-your-baby-crawl-and-why-its-important-to-keep-them-crawling/) to move forward or backward

![Tummy time at 6-10 months](https://i0.wp.com/blog.lovevery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/US-I-Blog-I-Tummy-Time-Stages-11-copy.webp?resize=1000%2C617&ssl=1)

* Transition from their belly to a sitting position, often using their hands and knees

## When to stop tummy time

Once your baby can get into and out of sitting on their own—and/or begins to crawl—you can stop doing reps of tummy time, says Coley. “But do continue to offer lots of [floor play](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/why-the-floor-is-the-best-place-for-your-baby-to-play/),” she adds.
