Right now, your newborn is only awake for very brief periods. When you notice their eyes open, you can provide them with a little sensory stimulation—but not too much. If they become overstimulated, they won’t be able to absorb new information easily or at all.

## Simple ways to engage your baby, one sense at a time

### Visual system

Keep the lights dim and drapes partially closed to encourage your baby to open their eyes. Research shows that newborns prefer looking at faces and can focus best at an 8- to 12-inch distance. As you cradle your baby, try spending a few moments gazing at each other’s faces. You can show them a **[Simple Black & White Card](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker)**, but even that may be too stimulating in their first few days.

### Auditory system

Hum or sing a simple song. If you have other children, this can be a good way for them to interact with their new sibling.

### Olfactory system

Your scent is familiar and reassuring to your baby, so hold them close, especially when they’re upset.

### Somatosensory system

Gently stroke their skin with different materials. You can use your fingers, a soft blanket, a family pet’s fur, or even gentle kisses ❤️
