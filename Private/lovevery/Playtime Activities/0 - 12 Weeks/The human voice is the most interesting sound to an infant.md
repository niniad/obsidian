Studies have shown that babies move their limbs in synchrony with human speech almost at birth. Try talking to your baby at least one hour per day cumulatively. Even when they’re asleep, they’ll hear your voice.

## Sing to provide comfort and connection during tummy time

Encourage your little one to stay in tummy time by lying face-to-face and singing to them.

Your face and joyful, rhythmic singing are calming for your baby, as their brain co-regulates through social engagement. Your warm smile, slow, steady breathing, calm voice, and eye contact in tummy time can help them feel safe and content. They’ll love looking up and seeing you right there ❤️

• Place your baby in tummy time on the floor, then lie down facing them.

• Hold the [Wooden Book](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker) in front of them so they can see its pages.

• Sing a song about the image on the page. Try using the tune to a familiar song if you feel stuck. Your baby loves your voice, no matter what and how you sing.

## 6 tips for how to talk to someone who doesn’t (yet) talk back

It’s awkward to talk to someone who doesn’t yet talk back, but the research is clear—there’s a strong link between a child’s vocabulary and the number of words spoken to them as a baby. In the first few months, your baby is constantly listening to the intonation, rhythm, and patterns of your voice. Even though they can’t understand what you’re saying yet, their brain is laying the groundwork for acquiring language.

### Some tips for talking to your baby:

#### Have a “conversation”

If they start to coo or make any kind of vocalization, talk back to them. Research consistently shows that back-and-forth conversation and child-directed speech matters just as much as—if not more than—the number of words your baby hears.

#### Reading

Try the reading position in the photo above—your baby will take more interest in the book you’re reading if they can see your face, too. It also helps support your baby’s body with your legs.

#### Narrate the day

Narrate as much as possible for your baby as you move about the house or neighborhood. Tell them about the produce while you are shopping, talk to them while you are changing a diaper. Talk to them face-to-face whenever you can.

#### House tours

When your baby is awake, facing forward in a wrap or with their head turned to the side in a carrier, walk around your house and talk about what you are seeing and experiencing. “House tours” will be a favorite activity throughout the first year.

#### Sing to your baby

Even if you don’t think you have a great voice, your baby will love it because it’s yours ❤️ Babies tune into singing even more than talking.

#### Talk in a slower, higher-pitched, sing-song voice

Use the voice that comes naturally to you when speaking to babies. Babies are pre-programmed to tune into higher tones, and learn more from the stretched out vowels in baby talk.

At 1 month of age, your newborn’s vision is still blurry: they can only see the outline of a book or part of a high-contrast image. Even so, reading to them is a powerful way to offer cognitive stimulation and foster a meaningful connection.

Short sessions throughout the day can increase exposure to language, develop your baby’s listening skills, and help you bond with your little one.

### 6 tips for reading to your 1-month-old

1. Hold the [Wooden Book](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker) 8 to 12 inches from your baby’s face.
2. Allow some time for your child’s eyes to focus on an image before turning the page.
3. Incorporate reading during tummy time or while you’re holding them.
4. Use your imagination to tell a story with the images. Your voice is their favorite sound ❤️
5. Try using a higher pitch and slower pace when reading, this helps your baby tune in to your words.
6. Read to your baby for short periods, working up to daily sessions around 2 months.
