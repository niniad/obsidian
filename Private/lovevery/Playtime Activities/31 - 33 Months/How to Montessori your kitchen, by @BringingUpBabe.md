What we do every day in the kitchen may seem common and redundant to us, but it’s new and exciting to your two-year-old 🙂 The idea of setting up a toddler-friendly Montessori kitchen might feel overwhelming: Do I need new furniture? Do I need to reorganize my kitchen?

Keep in mind that these are only suggestions and are meant to help your child, not make your life harder. You can decide to implement all of these or only a few.

## Here’s how to set up your kitchen for your toddler the Montessori way:

* **A tall, safe step stool**: Sometimes called a learning tower, this stool can provide the boost your child needs to prep food at your kitchen counter. It also helps them reach the sink for washing hands or rinsing dishes. A chair or step stool—with close supervision—can serve as an alternative.
* **Cleaning supplies**: Designate a few kitchen towels; a small dustpan, brush, and trash bin; and a [spray bottle](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-enthusiast) filled with water for your child, so they can help clean up spills and crumbs.
* **[Child-sized utensils](https://lovevery.com/products/feeding-bundle):**Small kitchen utensils and tools fit nicely into your child’s hands and are easier to use than the ones designed for adults. Small eating utensils, pitchers, scoops, child-safe choppers, whisks, and rolling pins are all great options.
* **Low storage**: Store items your child uses regularly—like plates, cups, silverware, cleaning rags, and kitchen tools—in a drawer or [on a shelf](https://lovevery.com/products/the-montessori-playshelf) they can reach.
* **Water station and snack area**: A small snack “station” will allow your child to independently serve their own snack or get a glass of water throughout the day.

* **Seating**: Instead of a high chair consider setting up a small table and chair just for your child. Here, they can have a snack, practice napkin folding, and maybe even prepare food. A space-saving alternative is a highchair (without a tray) that can be pulled right up to the family dining table.
