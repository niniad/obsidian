The [Investigator Play Kit](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-investigator) is designed to support your child’s emerging executive functioning. Sound fancy? It’s definitely an important part of your two-year-old’s development, and, as always, we’re going to make it fun for you and your family.

We practice the critical skills of executive functioning—control, organization, thinking creatively, and paying attention—for our entire lives. The Playthings in the Investigator Play Kit expose and cultivate these skills, giving your child a head start with time management, goal completion, and collaboration.

Soon you’ll receive innovative Playthings that are tailor-made to help your child pay close attention, persist, stretch their working memory, and not only navigate but also manage big feelings. As always, we hope you use this Play Kit to play, learn, and connect. Every moment is an opportunity for joy and growth.

The Play Guide provides endless learning resources for you and your little one: make the most of each Plaything, explore more ideas for at-home activities, and understand your child’s behavior through an expert’s eyes.
