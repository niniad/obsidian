Even if you can’t understand everything your toddler says right now, you may be on your way to having your first real conversations with them ❤️ They’re developing more complex vocabulary, beginning to understand sentence structure, and learning to share their thoughts. At this age, your child may:

**Know at least 250 words.** Age 2 is a time of rapid vocabulary development. Your child may now be using pronouns, possessives, and plurals. Their expanded vocabulary means they also may be starting to carry on conversations more fluently. As you talk back-and-forth, use rich, complex language to help them learn new words: “That elephant is **humongous!**” or “That **oak** tree is so tall and **beautiful**.”

**Speak in simple sentences.** Your child may start to string together short 3 to 5 word sentences—like, “Mama eat apple” or “I go play outside.”  You can help your child learn new word combinations by changing up the lyrics to a favorite song. For example, use the tune of “The Wheels on the Bus” to sing about the [Wooden Camper](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-free-spirit?srsltid=AfmBOorksImnyff_8a5zDmIn5bifxVjGb5RO431YwqaL4IHWBR45WXij) and the peg people from the [Van Go Outdoor Adventure](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-free-spirit?srsltid=AfmBOorksImnyff_8a5zDmIn5bifxVjGb5RO431YwqaL4IHWBR45WXij) set: “The people in the camper go up and down, up and down, up and down…”

**Ask wh- questions.** Is your child starting to ask “why?” or “what’s that?” Learning to ask questions helps your toddler follow their innate curiosity and get information they want or need.You can encourage their critical thinking by asking them more complex questions. For example, while reading [“The Play Date”](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-investigator) together, ask: “Why is Ansel sad?” At this age, your child might have an answer—or you might need to offer a response to your own question: “He wanted to play with the cars.”

**Tell stories.** At this age, your child may be able to recount something that happened during their day, like what they ate for lunch. They may also narrate a simple imaginary story—for example, taking their doll to the doctor. To help your child practice storytelling, invite them to “read” you a book. They can describe what they see in the pictures to tell a story of their own, or you can ask simple questions to guide them.

## When to seek support for your child’s language development

If your child’s vocabulary seems limited, their speech is very difficult to understand, or they have a hard time talking with other children, you may want to bring it up with their pediatrician. A speech-language evaluation can provide personalized guidance and recommendations for next steps.
