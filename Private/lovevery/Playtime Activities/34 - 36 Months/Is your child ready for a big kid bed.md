It’s natural to assume that a toddler who climbs out of their crib is ready for a big kid bed, right? Not so fast 🙃 The transition to a bed is a big change for a 2-year-old and rushing the process can backfire. So how do you know when it’s time to make the change? Lovevery pediatric sleep expert Lauren Lappen offers these tips:

### How to decide when it’s time to transition from a crib to a bed

* It can be hard for a young child to stay in bed when they know they can easily get out to play or come find you. Wait until you feel your child has the self-control to remain in bed after they’re tucked in.
* If your child asks for a bed and you think they can handle it, it may be time to move them out of their crib. This often happens around age 3—but not always.
* There’s no need to move your child just because they’re a certain age. A 3-year-old who is sleeping happily in their crib is getting good rest—and hopefully, you are, too.
* You may be tempted to move your child to a bed when they start potty learning. But they likely won’t be getting up at night to use the bathroom for a while. Even if they’re staying dry during the day, nighttime potty learning typically takes much longer. Moving to a bed and potty learning are both big transitions—and it’s better to do just one at a time.

### Tips for making the switch from a crib to a bed

* About 3 to 5 days before making the switch, let your child know they’ll be sleeping in a new bed soon. Make a countdown calendar to visually show them when it will happen.
* Explain that their new bed won’t have walls like their crib does, but it’s still important to stay in their bed when it’s time to sleep. You can give your child a short mantra to repeat and practice: “I stay in bed until Mama and Papa come get me.” Understanding that a bed still has boundaries—even without crib rails—is a bit of a cognitive leap for your child, so you may need to keep reinforcing it.
* Experts recommend keeping a young child’s new mattress no more than three feet off the ground. You can try putting the crib mattress directly on the floor or introducing a twin bed mattress without its frame.
* Consider putting your child’s new mattress or toddler bed in the same part of the room as their crib for consistency. You could also place it a cozy corner to create a sense of safety ❤️
* Read books like “[In My Own Bed](https://www.amazon.com/My-Own-Bed-Tricky-Topics/dp/195715232X)” to help your child understand what will happen: They’ll climb into bed and say goodnight, then stay in their bed until you come get them in the morning.
* Invite your toddler to help pick out some new sheets and a blanket for their new bed. Give them a choice between two or three different patterns.
* Stick to your usual bedtime routine. Try to do each step in the routine in the same order for consistency.
* Avoid making more than one big transition at a time. Making the switch to a bed is already a big deal, so wait to lose the pacifier or start potty learning.
* Encourage your toddler to show off their new bed to visitors.

### Consider new safety precautions

When your child can get out of bed freely, their room—and potentially your entire home—is now open to them. A few safety considerations to keep in mind:

* A baby gate at their bedroom door is considered a hazard in case of fire. Instead, consider using a video monitor to keep an eye on them.
* To keep the room as safe as possible, double check for hazards like cords, drapes, uncovered outlets, pets, stairs, and accessible water. Make sure all large furniture is safely bolted or otherwise stable.
* A bunk bed sounds exciting, but even with guardrails, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends [waiting until at least age 6](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/sleep/Pages/Bunk-Beds-Safety-Information-for-Parents.aspx) to let your child onto the top bunk.

### Be patient with your child and yourself

It’s possible that your child may not take to the bed right away, and that’s okay. Even children who initially show excitement may feel nervous or uncertain for the first few nights in their new bed. With your patience and encouragement, your child should feel comfortable soon ❤️
