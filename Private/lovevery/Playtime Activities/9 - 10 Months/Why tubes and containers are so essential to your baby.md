Your baby is beginning to understand that things fall out of a tube and stay put in a container, a concept they’ll be increasingly interested in until well after they turn 1. Research suggests babies who play with tubes and containers have a more advanced understanding of “containment,” or when something will or won’t stay inside something else.

## Here are some fun ways to play with a clear tube:

* Tape the [Clear Tube](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-explorer) to the wall and have your baby reach while sitting (or stand with support) and drop the ball through the tube into the [Treasure Basket](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-inspector) below.
* Show your baby how a ball goes into and then falls out of the tube. Have them pick up the ball and do it again.
* Tilt the tube on a pillow and have your baby put the ball into it. Your baby will see it roll down the incline, like a slide, and fall out.
* The tube and [floating ball](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-thinker) are fun in the bathtub, too!
