Is your friend’s baby pulling up on furniture and walking at 9 months, while your baby is working to get their belly off the ground and crawl? At this age, the typical range of development is wide, especially for physical skills like crawling, pulling to stand, and walking. Comparing your baby to others is hard to resist, so it can be grounding to talk to your pediatrician about your own baby’s progress ❤️

## Leading up to the visit

**Tune into your baby’s vocalizations** Your child’s pediatrician will want to ensure your baby is making vocalizations. These may sound like:

1. Babbles (consisting of sounds along the lines of ‘baba,’ ‘mama,’ and ‘dada’)
2. Squeals
3. [Laughter](https://lovevery.com/community/blog/child-development/when-do-babies-start-laughing/)

In the days leading up to your appointment, tune into your baby’s vocalizations so you can assess where they are. If your baby isn’t smiling back at you or occasionally engaging in back-and-forth sounds, bring it up with the doctor.

**Monitor other developmental milestones to monitor** Pediatrician and Lovevery expert Dr. Mona Amin says that at 9 months, many babies are [sitting independently](https://lovevery.com/community/blog/child-development/supporting-your-new-little-sitter/), [rolling in both directions](https://lovevery.com/community/blog/child-development/everything-you-need-to-know-about-babies-and-rolling/), babbling, starting to [use their forefinger and thumb to pick up food](https://lovevery.com/community/blog/child-development/week-38-self-feeding-develops-your-babys-fine-motor-skills/), and enjoy games like peekaboo. Talk with your doctor if your baby isn’t exhibiting these skills and if you have any concerns.

## At your baby’s 9-month doctor’s appointment

**Ask your grossest baby [poop](https://lovevery.com/community/blog/child-development/what-should-baby-poop-look-like/) questions** As your baby eats more solid foods, you’ll likely notice variations in their bowel movements. If loose stools or constipation are concerns, your pediatrician may have some recommendations on how to adjust your baby’s diet.

**Ask about food allergies or sensitivities** Food allergy symptoms—including hives, vomiting, or trouble breathing—need to be treated immediately. These kinds of symptoms tend to be more severe and show up minutes or up to an hour after being exposed to a certain food. If your baby has a family history of allergies or has severe eczema, alert your pediatrician as soon as you’re aware of it. Some of the symptoms of a food sensitivity—like diarrhea, gas, bloating, and constipation—might also be a good topic to bring up.

**Consider dental needs** If your baby has teeth, they’re ready for a soft bristle toothbrush with a tiny smear of fluoride toothpaste (no larger than a grain of rice). If you’re still waiting on teeth to come in, you can use a washcloth, a silicone brush, or even your finger to mimic the act of brushing and get your baby used to the process. Many experts recommend scheduling that first dental appointment before your baby’s first birthday, or about six months after the first tooth emerges.

**Bring up your child’s fears** At this age, you may notice your baby has some [separation anxiety](https://lovevery.com/community/blog/child-development/how-to-ease-your-babys-separation-anxiety/) and new fears of less familiar people. That’s typical developmentally, but your pediatrician may have some good ideas about how to handle specific circumstances such as fear of hair washing at [bath time](https://lovevery.com/community/blog/playtime-activities/cognitive-and-emotional-benefits-of-bath-time/) or challenges at daycare drop-off.
