Have you ever found your baby standing in their crib, crying because they can’t figure out how to sit down again? This is because pulling up to stand is easier for your baby to learn than lowering back down.

Babies typically learn to pull up to [standing](https://blog.lovevery.com/skills-stages/standing/) between 6 and 10 months, and learn to lower back to a seated position between 9 and 10 months. Pediatric Occupational Therapist Rachel Coley shares the following tips to teach your baby how to learn to get out of a standing position on their own.

## 3 ways to help your baby lower from standing

1. **Encourage ‘standing to sitting’ play.** Sit cross-legged in front of a low surface like a coffee table or sofa with the cushions removed. [Place a toy on the table or sofa to entice your baby to pull up to stand](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/standing-play-helps-develop-pre-walking-skills/). Once they’ve been standing for a minute or two, gently guide their hips down into your lap, so they get used to the motion and feeling of sitting down. Try to offer as little support as you can—they’ll mostly need help with balance.
2. **Practice mini-squats.** When your baby is already standing and holding onto a surface, offer them a [toy](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits) or an inviting object at thigh or knee level, just below their reach. This encourages them to do a ‘mini-squat’: holding on with one hand, they bend their knees and lower themselves just enough to grasp the object. Use playthings and activities with built-in repetition, like [placing multiple objects into a container](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/collecting-and-transporting/). Doing ‘reps’ up and down helps them build strength 😉
3. **Offer opportunities for full-squat play.** Once your baby can do mini-squats more easily, start offering toys at floor level. For balance and support, make sure they’re standing at a stable surface that’s easy for them to grip.
