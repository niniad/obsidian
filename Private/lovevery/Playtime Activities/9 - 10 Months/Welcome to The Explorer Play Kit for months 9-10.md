# Welcome to The Explorer Play Kit for months 9-10

What does your baby have in common with famous explorers? An overwhelming desire to find out everything there is to know, driven by a need to discover the unknown. You have a baby who is either on the move already or well on their way, who can understand more and more of what you say, and is fascinated by almost everything they can grab, squeeze, bang, fling, and mouth. [The Explorer Play Kit](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-explorer) is built for explorers. The Clear Tube with its Stacking Rings teaches foundational lessons about gravity, volume, rolling and sliding, and more.

For many ways to play and learn with your explorer (plus developmental information and tons of new activities), be sure to check out the included Play Guide.
