As your baby’s interests evolve, they will learn to play with their familiar toys in new ways. Here are some ideas for how to keep the Lovevery toys your baby already loves in active rotation, long past the infant months.

### Mirror on the wall

As your baby gets closer to [walking](https://blog.lovevery.com/skills-stages/walking/), they may practice “cruising” while holding onto a surface like the couch or the wall. Keep your baby motivated as they cruise by hanging up the **[Framed Mirror](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-charmer)** on the wall at their eye level, or adhering the **[‘Things I See’ Texture Cards](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-inspector)** to the wall with painter’s tape. The cards and mirror entice your baby to keep cruising along the wall to see what’s coming next.

### First words practice

Over the next few months, your baby will be trying hard to [imitate sounds](https://blog.lovevery.com/skills-stages/talking-language-development/). Use the [**‘Parts of Me’** board book](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-senser) to point to words with pictures. At first, your baby may be able to say the first sound of the word. As their language skills grow with practice, they’ll learn to say whole words.

### Container play

Your baby may already love playing with different containers, and this interest will likely continue into toddlerhood. Encourage your baby to try fitting pieces of the **[Roll and Build Cone Set](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-explorer)** into a larger container like the **[Magic Tissue Box](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-senser)** (with the lid off) or the [**Treasure Basket**.](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-inspector) Some cones will fit easily, while others may not—which encourages your baby to explore and problem-solve.

### Playing catch

Your baby probably enjoys holding or rolling the **[Felt Balls](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-inspector)**, but they aren’t just for babies. As a toddler, your child can use them to learn to play catch. No one will get hurt even if the ball is thrown a little too hard.

### Scavenger hunt

Once your toddler is walking independently, going on an outdoor scavenger hunt can be a fun adventure. Bring along a few of the **[Drip Drop Cups](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-inspector)** for your toddler to fill with all their treasures—acorns, rocks, leaves, or small sticks.

### Quiet and loud

Your child’s favorite baby playthings can be re-used to illustrate new concepts in toddlerhood. Around 16 to 18 months, your child will begin to understand opposites such as “quiet” versus “loud.” Use a plaything that makes a quiet sound like the **[Wooden Rattle](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-charmer)** and compare it to a loud noise such as banging one of the **[Wooden Balls](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-inspector)** on the **[Ball Drop Box](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-inspector)**. Say the words “quiet” and “loud” with each sound to introduce new vocabulary.

### Hide and seek playthings

Support your child’s problem-solving skills with a fun hide-and-seek game. Use the **[Bright & Light Play Scarf](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-explorer)** to cover one of your child’s favorite baby playthings like the **[Spinning Rainbow](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-senser)** or the **[Rainbow Ball](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-senser)**. Encourage your child to search for the hidden plaything: “Can you find the ball?”

### Secret collections

The [**Crinkle Bag**](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-charmer) will be just the thing for your toddler when you start to discover them stashing random “collections” of different items around your home. Containers are fascinating throughout the late infant and toddler years.

### Balance practice

Once your toddler starts standing with support, the **[Transparent Tube Tower](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-explorer)** can be used to help them work on balance. While your toddler is standing and holding onto a support surface, offer them one of the **[Transparent Tubes](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-explorer)** to hold in their hands. Hold another tube in your hand and encourage them to tap your tube with theirs. Keep your tube slightly out of their reach and to the side so they have to turn and reach to tap it.

### Pulling strength

Weave the ****[Bright & Light Play Scarf](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-explorer)**** through one of the holes in the  ****[Ball Drop Box](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-inspector)**** so that a corner of it is peeking out. Encourage your child to pull the scarf out using both hands. Pulling with both hands encourages the development of coordination and muscle strength.

### Family photo album

You can personalize the [**Soft Book**](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-charmer) and [**Standing Card Holder**](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker)by adding photos of family and friends (print size: 5×7). This is a fun way to connect your baby with loved ones, especially those they might not get to see as often. As your child’s language skills grow, looking at these photos may help them learn each person’s name.
