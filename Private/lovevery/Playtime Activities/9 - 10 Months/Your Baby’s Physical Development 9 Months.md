Your baby is on the move and wants to get closer to things that interest them so they can find out more about their world. Your baby is also experimenting with what their little bodies can do, and learning each day what they are physically capable of. This is also the most common stage where parents start to wonder about crawling milestones.

[Jessica Rolph](https://www.instagram.com/jessicarolph/) (Lovevery Co-Founder and CEO) and Rachel Coley (Licensed Occupational Therapist and Founder of [Cando Kiddo](https://www.candokiddo.com/)) cover the gross motor milestones that parents wonder most about during this stage.

Your baby’s development path is just as unique and personal as your baby. All little ones develop so differently. The last thing we want to do is put pressure on parents or get caught up in milestones and timelines. We discuss these topics so that you can use this information as helpful guidelines to prepare for this stage and what to expect next.

### Steps Toward Crawling

* Mini milestones that lead to crawling

### Keeping Tummy Time Interesting

* Sensory input and creative ways to play
* Face-to-face engagement

### Pulling Up

* Tips to create a soft and safe environment
