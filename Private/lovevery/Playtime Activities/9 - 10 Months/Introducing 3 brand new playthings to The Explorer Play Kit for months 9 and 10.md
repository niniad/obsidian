### Pincer Chime Ball

The Pincer Chime Ball chimes as it rolls in unpredictable ways. It’s designed to be too large for your baby to hold with just one hand, encouraging two-handed coordination and grasp strength. The knotted strings also help your baby practice their pincer grasp as they pick up the ball.

### Transparent Tube Tower

Research suggests that play tubes and transparent toys can help babies master the concept of containment. Designed for stacking and nesting, the colorful Transparent Tube Tower helps your baby discover how some things fit inside others—and some don’t. At bath time, the Transparent Tube Tower allows them to explore different ways water flows out of each tube. While your baby doesn’t understand color mixing yet, they may notice how the colors change as the tubes are nested.

### Roll & Build Cone Set

At this age, your baby may start to pick up a small toy and then intentionally set it down. Doing this with objects that stack and nest encourages your baby to practice a grab-and-release pattern that supports fine motor development and hand-eye coordination. Let your baby place smaller objects in each cone for a lesson in containment or hide objects underneath the cones to explore object permanence.
