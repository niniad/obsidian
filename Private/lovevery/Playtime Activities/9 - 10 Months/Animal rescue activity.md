This fun activity looks so simple, and it helps strengthen so many skills. You can try this starting around 8-9 months on any flat surface like a floor or wall, but we especially love it in the bathroom since it gives us some time to get ready for the day.

All you need are your little one’s favorite [small toys](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits) and tape! (We love painter’s tape or washi tape). Let your baby rescue those animals and celebrate when they’re all free.

So, what skills does this activity do? It strengthens their fine and gross motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and grasping—and it also helps build core strength.

Try it out and let us know how your baby likes it!
