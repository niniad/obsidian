Once your baby begins eating solid foods, there’s no need to stick to bland, one-ingredient purees and rice cereal. Offering more complex options with subtle herbs and spices isn’t just okay, it might actually help your baby become a more open-minded and adventurous eater.

Some of these flavors may already be familiar to your child. While breastfeeding, they taste a little of whatever you eat. So if you enjoy a spice like cinnamon, for instance, when your baby comes across it again in solid food, they will be more likely to recognize the taste and like it 🙂

**Just be sure to avoid chilis and other spices containing capsaicin**. They stimulate pain receptors on the tongue and throughout the digestive tract.

## Introduce herbs and spices as you would any new food

* **Offer a tiny amount of 1 new ingredient at a time**. You can mix it with a food that your baby has already tried, such as plain yogurt or applesauce.
* **After each one, wait 3 to 5 days to try another new one**; that way, if your child has an adverse reaction, you can identify the source.

## 14 aromatic seasonings to try

1. Cinnamon
2. Ginger
3. Mild curry powder
4. Nutmeg
5. Cloves
6. Turmeric
7. Coriander
8. Cardamom
9. Cumin
10. Fennel
11. Dill
12. Oregano
13. Thyme
14. Black pepper
