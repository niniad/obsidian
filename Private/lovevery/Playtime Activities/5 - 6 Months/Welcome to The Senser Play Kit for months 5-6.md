# Welcome to The Senser Play Kit for months 5-6

Source: https://blog.lovevery.com/product-recommendations/welcome-to-the-senser-play-kit-for-months-5-6/

It may seem sudden, but you have a 5-month-old! Babies at this age are experiencing huge changes, cognitively and with their fine and gross motor skills. Over the next two months, if they haven’t already, your child may experiment more with sitting, banging objects on surfaces, rolling over, and (of course) exploring everything with their hands and mouth. This is also the time when babbling starts—a major attempt at language! Babbling is those early consonants and vowels like “ba” and “da,” often repeated.

[The Senser Play Kit](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-senser) is all about these developments. Your baby’s love of pulling items out of containers is the reason we made the Magic Tissue Box, so your little one can methodically remove every “tissue” from the box without the waste or cleanup. The Tummy Time Wobbler is a great way to keep your baby working on tummy time, which is still critical even as your baby learns to sit and move in other ways.

As always, the Play Guide gives ideas on how to use the playthings, as well as immediately usable activities, tips, and bite-sized developmental information.
