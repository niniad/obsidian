Play and learning go hand in hand, according to The National Association of Education for Young Children. Working play into each day benefits your baby’s social, physical, and cognitive development, but that doesn’t mean it must be structured or stressful to have a lasting effect.

We’ve collected our favorite simple activities to help you plan less and play more throughout your baby’s first year. Each of these easy activities offers rich developmental benefits with little to no prep.

## **0–3 months**

### [Skin-to-skin moments](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/why-skin-to-skin-time-isnt-just-for-the-hospital/)

Skin-to-skin time isn’t just for newborns. Babies (and caregivers ❤️) of all ages are calmed by its soothing effects and other physiological benefits. Try it in a bath, during a feeding, or face-to-face during tummy time.

### [Kicking play](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/kicking-play-helps-your-baby-learn-to-roll/)

Kicking builds the muscles your baby needs for rolling. It also gives them an immediate response to their movements, setting up an exciting feedback loop. Try these four ways to get your baby kicking and learning about cause and effect.

### [Pillow crawling](https://blog.lovevery.com/playtime-activities/pillow-crawling/)

Finding new ways to burn off energy at home requires some creativity and willingness to experiment. For pillow crawling, your baby must use both body and brain to climb to the top of Pillow Mountain and (hopefully) find a nap on the other side ❤️

### [Fun with sensory bags](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/endless-fun-with-a-sensory-bag/)

Fill sensory bags with water, buttons, straws, peas, or anything else you can dream up. Sensory bags give your baby a safe way to examine the small objects they’re so interested in. Do keep a close watch on your baby as they explore, especially if they tend to mouth the bag. This DIY activity takes a little bit of prep, but your baby will love it.

## **9–12 months**

### [Laundry basket web](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/laundry-basket-spider-web/)

A feeling of success motivates your baby to keep trying to free their playthings from this “web.” This easy activity helps them practice problem-solving and motor skills.

### [Water and ice](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/fresh-ideas-with-water-and-ice/)

With just water and ice, your baby can compare temperatures, explore solids and liquids, and (of course) splash. Best of all, it works at every stage of development.

### [Tubes and containers](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/why-tubes-and-containers-are-so-essential-to-your-baby/)

Your baby is beginning to understand that things fall out of a tube and stay put in a container, a concept they’ll be increasingly interested in well after they turn 1.

### [Balls and muffin tin](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/balls-and-muffin-tin-activity/)

Taking things out of a container and putting them back in is so much fun for your baby, who’s gaining control of their hands. Muffin tins and a few balls (or pom poms) are all you need for this scientific exploration of in and out.
