Your baby’s color vision has improved now (it’s not as good as an adult’s, but getting better) and they’re starting to be able to see in three dimensions, perceiving if something is closer or farther away.

## Here’s how you can help your baby’s developing eyes:

* Offer lots of opportunities for your baby to reach, bat, and kick objects hanging overhead
* Give them time to [explore on the floor](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-gym) (less time in baby seats), because when they move their body, their eyes work to adjust focus
* Give them objects to grasp and mouth
* Help your baby clap and motion with their hands while singing patty-cake. This helps them coordinate between their hands and eyes
