This fun sensory activity introduces your baby to tactile play, and might even make tummy time more enjoyable!

Just get a piece of cardboard, cut holes out, and tape different fabrics and materials to it.

We love using fabric scraps, sandpaper, felt, bubble wrap, foil, [mirror card](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-charmer), carpet sample, or wrapping paper.
