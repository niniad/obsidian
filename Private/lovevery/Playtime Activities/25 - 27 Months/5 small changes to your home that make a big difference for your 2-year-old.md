When you’re 2, finding your shoes or getting a drink of water can be a lot harder than it sounds. Some simple switches to your home can help your toddler with these tasks—and make your life easier in the long run.

Research shows [enabling independence](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/why-fewer-choices-help-your-child-establish-independence/) now may encourage cooperation and self-reliance in the future.

## How to help your child do more on their own

### 1. Place a box or basket near the door just for their shoes

It can be challenging for a 2-year-old to locate their [shoes](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/a-2-year-old-friendly-guide-to-putting-on-shoes-and-socks/) when they’re mixed in with a bunch of other pairs. Having a designated box helps them find their shoes when it’s time to go out—and also makes clear where shoes should be put away.

### 2. Provide a step-stool they can carry

Brushing teeth, washing hands, and getting a drink of water likely all require your child to use a step-stool—and they happen in different locations. Being able to move a stool from one place to the next sets them up to eventually [do important self-care tasks independently](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/how-to-montessori-your-bathroom/).

### 3. Keep child-safe dishes on a low, open shelf

While it will be some time before they’re preparing their own snacks, you can plant the seed by making their dishes more accessible. This helps them get involved with setting the table for dinner or putting their own dishes away as you unload the dishwasher.

### 4. Provide a low laundry basket

Help your child get in the habit of not leaving their clothes on the floor by giving them an accessible place to toss their dirty socks. Reaching up and putting clothes into a high hamper isn’t as effective because they can’t see where their clothes are going.

### 5. Help them reach—and clean up—their toys

[Low shelves and open storage bins](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/how-to-montessori-a-childs-play-space-by-cristina-philatre-montessori-madre/) allow your child to easily find their playthings and put them away. [**The Montessori Playshelf**](https://lovevery.com/products/the-montessori-playshelf) was made with this in mind 😉
