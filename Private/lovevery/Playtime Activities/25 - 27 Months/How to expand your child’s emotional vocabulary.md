Research shows that using a range of emotion words when talking to your child about their feelings can help build their emotional intelligence.

Using specific and even complex words to describe how your child feels gives them a deeper, more nuanced understanding of their emotions. When you say a word like “enthusiastic” instead of “happy” or “disappointed” instead of “sad,” you can more closely pinpoint your toddler’s actual emotional state. You also give them an opportunity to learn the sound, context, and meaning of a new word.

For example, if they’re upset about not getting the toy they wanted, you might try saying, “You didn’t get the blue car, you got the yellow one instead. You’re **disappointed**.”
