Give your 2-year-old a pair of scissors? Really?

Yes. At this age, using toddler-safe scissors is important for building fine motor skills and hand strength. But the benefits go beyond even that. Scissor practice also helps build key cognitive skills.

## The cognitive benefits of using scissors at age 2

* **Bilateral integration:** using both sides of the body simultaneously—for example, one hand holding paper, the other using scissors
* **Visual-motor skills**: coordinating the eyes and hands together
* **Sequencing**: following steps in a particular order—hold the paper with one hand, hold the scissors with thumb on top, then alternate opening and closing scissors
* **Focus:** sustaining attention on a task longer

## Tips for introducing scissors

Your 2-year-old won’t be able to cut with precision yet. The goal at this stage is to help your child become comfortable holding scissors and making small snips.

**Keep thumbs up.** When your child holds scissors, ensure their thumb is facing up. Their middle finger can go into the loop, but it doesn’t matter where their other fingers fall. To help your child remember, you can draw a smiley face or a star on their thumbnail with a washable marker. If they can see it, their thumb is in the right place 🙂

**Start small.** Give your child small pieces of paper that are easy for them to hold. You can also tape one side of the paper to a table or wall. This allows them to focus on cutting without having to hold the paper steady.

**Change the material.** Encourage your child to cut modeling dough, junk mail, or even herbs. If your child seems ready for a challenge, they can try cutting card stock or other heavy paper. The thicker material can help strengthen their hands and improve their cutting accuracy.

**Make a paper chain.** Once your child has gotten the hang of snipping, try making a simple craft. Cut several long paper strips about ½-inch wide. Invite your child to snip them into shorter, 4-inch segments. Roll each one into a loop, link it with the next one, and tape them into a chain.
