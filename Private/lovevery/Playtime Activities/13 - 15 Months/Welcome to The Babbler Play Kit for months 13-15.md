# Welcome to The Babbler Play Kit for months 13-15

Source: https://blog.lovevery.com/product-recommendations/welcome-to-the-babbler-play-kit-for-months-13-15/

You’ve got a Babbler! A one-year-old, a toddler—whatever you call them now—your child is ready to the take the world by storm. You may be hearing first words (with a lot of babbling still in the mix!), seeing first steps, and a lot of other major milestones in the coming months. [The Babbler Play Kit](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-babbler), designed precisely with your child’s development in mind, is full of playthings and activities that tap into the magic world of a brand-new one-year-old.

The Slide & Seek Ball Run, for example, combines all kinds of emerging developmental skills into one amazing toy. The ball won’t fit through the top without a little nudge, tapping into your child’s fine-motor and problem-solving abilities. After it completes its spiral slide, it falls into a box, with four unique ways to retrieve it. The pincer grasp, object permanence, resilience, patience—the Ball Run has it all.

There’s so much more, from sensory play to practice with relative concepts—and a fun new puzzle—for you and your child to explore together, supported as always by our informative and research-based Play Guide.
