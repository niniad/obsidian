Is your toddler constantly on the move—too busy to try a puzzle or sit through a whole book? Don’t worry, some toddlers are more naturally inclined to physical activity than others.

Of course, physical movement involves motor skills, but it also develops cognitive skills, such as planning and problem-solving.

If your child tends to be physically cautious or inclined to quiet, seated activities, here are some ways to get them moving, too.

## How to support your toddler’s need to move

### Give them safe spaces to explore

Even if you don’t have a dedicated playroom in your home, you can set up a small area—indoors or outdoors—for play, movement, and exploration. Young toddlers don’t have the impulse control and safety awareness to stay within verbal boundaries or those that are easily climbed over or pushed aside, so make sure the space is thoroughly toddler-proofed. Furniture should be anchored to walls, all cords or breakables should be out of reach and only age-safe toys should be included.

Even in a [“yes” space](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/creating-a-yes-space-for-your-baby/), supervision is important. Use visual check-ins, stay within earshot or use a baby monitor for indoor play, and stay within eyesight of your child outdoors since it’s impossible to thoroughly toddler-proof nature.

### Introduce new physical challenges

**Add obstacles** like pillows or cushions, a [play tunnel](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-tunnel), a big cardboard box, or a fort made with a sheet draped over a table for your toddler to navigate.

**Try walking on different surfaces** like thick grass, sand, and even small hills once your toddler is able to navigate a smooth, flat floor.

**Create opportunities to climb**, throw, push or pull large items, find small spaces to hide in, and dump out containers.

**Step up and down off curbs** and steps or practice climbing stairs.

**Provide small containers** likethe [Treasure Basket (The Inspector Play Kit)](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-inspector) so your toddler can [collect and transport objects](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/collecting-and-transporting/).

### Turn quiet activities into active ones

Make activities typically viewed as seated or quiet play—reading, building with blocks, puzzles—active. Here are a few ideas:

1. Play “hide-and-seek” with toys by placing them on top of furniture that’s safe to cruise along or climb on.
2. [Read aloud while your toddler jumps, rolls, or climbs next to you](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/squirming-and-grabbing-pages-what-reading-looks-like-at-this-age/).
3. Lay [blocks](https://lovevery.com/products/the-block-set) in a line longer than your child on the floor, then invite them to lie down and see how many blocks tall they are.
4. Place puzzle pieces in different places around the room, so they have to retrieve them one-by-one to solve the puzzle.
