## How can you encourage your toddler to be less clingy?

As your toddler ventures out into the world, they may need lots of reassurance. Clinging to you at a birthday party or play group is a sign that they’re seeking an internal sense of security and safety.

Physical check-ins can help your toddler gain the courage and confidence to explore. They may want to sit in your lap or be picked up at first. Once they’re ready to venture off, they may return to you or make eye contact from afar to ensure you’re still there.

As someone that they trust, you are their **secure base**, a place that they can come back to as often as needed. At times, this may feel a bit frustrating—maybe you’re craving some adult time or feel embarrassed that your toddler is the only one not joining the group. In these moments, by staying close and being a calm, steady presence, you’re actually helping your toddler learn to become more independent in the future.

If your toddler moves away, then stops, turns, and looks up at you and smiles, you can make eye contact and say, “I see you!” That’s often enough to reassure them that you’re watching and they’re safe ❤️ The more your toddler knows that you’re reliably available, the more confident they’ll likely be.

## Child care drop-offs: tips for easier goodbyes

When your toddler has separation anxiety, dropping them off at child care is much easier said than done. Your toddler’s crying and clinging can trigger a lot of emotions and your protective instincts. Some children have an easier time adjusting than others, but most will struggle with separating from you at some point. If you’re experiencing difficult drop-offs, know that your toddler will likely calm down within five minutes or less after you leave. Here are some strategies that can help ease your toddler’s anxiety when it’s time to say goodbye ❤️

### 1. Give them a sense of confidence

Showing your toddler that you trust their childcare providers is one of the best ways to ease their anxiety. Research shows that when toddlers are uncertain, they look to their caregivers to see how they should feel—known as “social referencing.” When you drop off your toddler, greet the people in the space with a smile, and take a moment to chat with the provider before you leave, if you can.

### 2. Resist the urge to sneak out

It can be tempting to make a quick exit when your toddler isn’t looking, especially if they seem happy. Even though it could trigger tears, saying goodbye helps your toddler build trust with you and their child care provider, and build positive associations with their child care space.

### 3. Tell them when you’ll be back

Your toddler doesn’t have a concept of time yet, but they do have a concept of routines. Timing your return to a specific part of their daily routine will give them a clearer expectation of when you’ll return. Let your toddler know, “I’ll be back right after nap time today, and then we’ll go home together.”

Your toddler’s child care provider can reinforce this during the day. If your child starts asking for you, the provider can say, “You really miss Daddy right now. Daddy always comes back after nap time! He’ll be so excited to see you, too.”

### 4. Have a short and sweet goodbye ritual

Keep your goodbye simple and consistent, and involve your toddler’s care provider if you can. “I’m going to go to work now. Charlie is going to take such good care of you while I’m at work! I can’t wait to read a story with you when I get back.” Leave with confidence, knowing that this is a great opportunity for the child care provider to comfort your toddler as they build their bond with each other.

### 5. Linger on the reunion

At pick-up time, you may feel rushed to get home. When you can, reconnect with your toddler in at the child care space. They may be excited to see you, distracted by an activity, or even tearful, expressing some delayed grief at your absence. Take a few minutes to savor the hugs, sit on the floor and play, or comfort them. Let your toddler know, “I really missed you today, and I’m so glad we’re back together.”

## Play doctor to ease checkup fears

Visiting the doctor can be an overwhelming experience for a toddler. Before your next appointment, read [Bea Gets a Checkup](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-realist) and engage in some pretend play. Use the [Really Real Flashlight](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-realist) to look into your toddler’s ears and ask them to stick out their tongue to check inside their mouth. Acting it out will help prepare your toddler and let them know what to expect.

## What parents are asking our experts…

> “My 22-month-old son has separation anxiety and a new sitter is coming over. Any tips?”

**Answer:**

It’s hard to leave your child in tears when you feel like you’re the only person he wants, but here are a few strategies that may help.

* **Tell him the plan in advance.** You might say, for instance, “After breakfast, your babysitter is coming to our house. Mommy’s going to give you three kisses, and then you and the babysitter will play. I’ll see you after nap time.” Even if your child gets upset, which he most likely will, you can repeat this script.
* **Beforehand, ask the babysitter to send you a picture.**Show it to your son when you talk to him about the sitter coming.
* **Ask your new sitter to come over 15 minutes before you need to leave.** Talk with them. Give them a house tour, with your son, so that he knows the sitter is familiar with his home.
* **Use a transitional object.** Give your son something of yours, like an old T-shirt, a bracelet, or a picture of you, as well as his favorite lovey.
* **Always say goodbye and leave when you say you will.**When the sitter arrives, follow through with your goodbye plan. Even if he’s crying, try to appear comfortable and confident as you go. Practicing a consistent goodbye routine will build your son’s trust. If you know that he’s fed, safe, and healthy, it’s okay for him to regulate his emotions on his own or with another trusted caregiver sometimes.
