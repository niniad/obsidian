Being far away from family and friends can be especially hard when you have a young child. You want your loved ones to know your toddler and your toddler to know them ❤️

Interactive video chats can help close that distance—and they’re one of the only forms of [screen time](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/we-did-all-the-research-on-screen-time-and-heres-what-we-found/) that experts enthusiastically endorse at this age.

According to research, the give-and-take of video chatting can build real emotional and cognitive connections for young children. During a video call, Grandpa can respond to your toddler’s cues and talk about what your child is doing in the moment in ways that TV characters can’t.

Of course, a meaningful video call isn’t always easy to pull off with a 1-year-old. A little preparation can help ensure that it goes more smoothly.

## Tips for planning a successful video chat

* **Time it carefully.** Schedule video chats when your toddler is likely to be well fed and rested. Before the call begins, give them a chance to run, climb, and move around.
* **Have a game plan.** Give your toddler a simple toy or activity during the chat to keep them engaged.Their chat partner can ask questions or comment on what your toddler is doing to create some connection.
* **Guide the conversation.** Toddlers can quickly lose interest in virtual conversations. Plan to be involved from start to finish to engage them and keep the dialogue going.
* **Connect words to images.** Help your toddler associate the words they hear to the objects and actions they see on the screen. For example, you could say, “Oh, it looks like PopPop is drinking his tea.” Encourage screen partners to do the same: “PopPop, Riley loves flowers. Can you tell us about the plants behind you?”
* **Keep realistic expectations.** Your toddler may only focus on the screen for a few minutes at a time, perhaps a bit longer if you plan an activity. A loved one may feel discouraged when a video call is short or your toddler wanders off. But research shows a young child can build an emotional connection with someone they chat with regularly, even if their interactions are brief.

## 5 toddler-friendly activities for better video chats

Planning a fun activity or game can help make it a better experience for everyone. Here are some ideas to get you started:

### 1. Take a “favorite things” tour

Before you log on, help your toddler collect a few favorite toys, stuffed animals, or even real pets. Once the chat starts, help them show each object to the person on the screen. Invite their loved one to show off a few of their favorite things, too.

### 2. Sing songs together

Join your toddler and their chat partner in singing “Itsy-Bitsy Spider” or “I’m a Little Teapot.” Perhaps you and your child can teach the hand motions so their faraway friend can lead the song next time.

### 3. Plan a virtual storytime

If you chat with the same person often, consider investing in two copies of the same [children’s books](https://blog.lovevery.com/product-recommendations/introducing-book-bundles-for-the-play-kits-by-lovevery/). Your toddler can look at their own copy as they listen to PopPop read the words.

### 4. Have a dance party

Choose some favorite songs and get moving 🙂 Even family members with limited mobility can sway in their seats as your toddler bounces and wiggles.

### 5. Let them play

Bring out a favorite plaything, like the [Geo Shapes Puzzle](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-realist), or one they haven’t seen in a few months, like the [Bunnies in the Felt Burrow](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-babbler) or the [Slide & Seek Ball Run](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-babbler). Giving your toddler something interesting to play with may help keep them on screen and give their chat partner a conversation starter.
