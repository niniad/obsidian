Focus is a skill that builds gradually from birth. As a newborn, your child’s ability to focus was limited and largely based on reflex—they mainly reacted to the sights and sounds closest to them. As they get older, your toddler can **choose** to focus on an activity, even if it’s just for a minute or two at a time. This small difference is evidence of a big and exciting shift in your child’s attention span.

## How long should your toddler be able to focus?

At 21 months, most toddlers can focus on a specific, chosen activity for two to three minutes, on average. Some toddlers will be able to pay attention to an activity for a bit longer, while others may need more support to stay focused for even a minute. Keep in mind that other factors can affect your toddler’s ability to focus. If they’re hungry, tired, or distracted by background noise, their attention span may be shorter.

## 4 subtle signs of your toddler’s developing focus

As you’ve probably already noticed, a toddler can pack **a lot** into two to three minutes 😉 Watch for these examples of focused attention in your 21-month-old’s daily routine:

1. Helping to put away one or two toys
2. Briefly focusing on you as you talk to them, like during a car ride or while playing together
3. [Looking at a book](https://blog.lovevery.com/product-recommendations/introducing-book-bundles-for-the-play-kits-by-lovevery/), either in your lap or independently, for a few minutes at a time
4. Investigating [a plaything](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-companion) for a few minutes before taking a break or switching to another activity

## What to expect as your toddler’s attention span develops

While it may seem like your toddler bounces from activity to activity right now, their attention span will grow over time. By age 4 or 5, your child may be able to focus on an activity for 10 to 15 minutes at a stretch. Giving them lots of opportunities for uninterrupted, distraction-free play now can help them develop this key skill.
