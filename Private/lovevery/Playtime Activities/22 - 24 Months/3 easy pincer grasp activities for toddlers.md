The pincer grasp (the coordination between your child’s adorable index finger and thumb) isn’t just for babies! Toddlers need to continue strengthening this coordination to help them write when they start school, feed themselves, button/zipper clothes, and so much more.

Activities or toys that have loose parts, where toddlers have to use their hands and fingers are crucial for building hand muscles, strength, and dexterity for future tasks.

## Here are our top 3 favorite pincer grasp activities:

### Pipe Cleaners and a Colander

This simple fine motor activity also encourages focus and concentration.

**What you need for this:**

* [Pipe cleaners](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=pipe+cleaners&ref=nb_sb_noss_1)
* A colander

You might have to demonstrate this activity to your little one. Start by placing a few pipe cleaners in the colander’s holes and encourage your toddler to remove them or place a few pipe cleaners of their own.

### Craft Matchsticks and a Container

This is an easy way to keep those little hands busy by using household items.

**What you need for this:**

* Any container with a soft plastic lid (we repurposed an oatmeal container)
* [Craft Matchsticks](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=craft+matchsticks&ref=nb_sb_noss_2)

Poke or cut holes into the lid and you’re all set!

The motion of pushing the sticks through the holes helps strengthen the small muscles that control the hand, fingers and thumb.

### Pom Poms and a Carton

Pom poms are a toddler favorite! In addition to strengthening fine motor skills, this activity deepens your little one’s understanding of object permanence and gives them the opportunity to practice their focus and concentration.

**What you need for this:**

* [Pom poms](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=pom+poms&ref=nb_sb_noss_1)
* Milk or juice carton

Just cut out a flap at the bottom of the carton and have your child poke the pom poms through the top spout.

You can add more learning to this by naming the [different colors](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/the-better-way-to-help-your-toddler-learn-colors/) as they poke the pom pom through, sorting the pom poms by color and/or size, or counting the pom poms outloud.
