# Welcome to The Companion Play Kit for months 22-24

Source: https://blog.lovevery.com/product-recommendations/welcome-to-the-companion-play-kit-for-months-22-24/

As your toddler closes in on two years of age—that was fast!—there are a ton of exciting new developments beginning to emerge. From an explosion of language, to building taller and more stables towers, to kicking a ball forward while only falling down some of the time, you’ve got an active, constantly-learning companion on your hands.

[The Companion Play Kit](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-companion) is a celebration of the things your child can do, and some things they’re just starting to explore: coloring, matching, comparing, categorizing, bilateral coordination (using both hands at once), stacking, sorting, and so much more. The Mosaic Button Board, for instance, works the muscles in your child’s fingers and hands as they concentrate hard to place pegs into slots, while also matching colors and patterns. Like all the toys in the box, it just what your child needs to tap into their play.

As you approach a brand new age, enjoy the last months of having a one-year-old. As always, the Play Guide gives ideas on how to use the playthings, as well as immediately usable activities, tips, and bite-sized developmental information.
