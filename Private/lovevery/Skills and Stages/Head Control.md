Tummy Time, Rolling

When a baby is born, they don’t yet have the strength and coordination to hold up their head. A newborn’s head is heavy relative to the rest of their body, and they need to build neck strength to lift it and move it side to side. Head control is an important first motor skill that your baby must gain before they learn to roll over, sit, crawl, and, eventually, walk.

## How to hold your newborn

For the first few weeks of a baby’s life, it’s important to support their head and neck whenever you pick them up or hold them. When lifting your baby, slide one of your hands under their head and neck as you place your other hand under their bottom. Continue providing this support as long as you hold them. You can also cradle their head in the crook of your bent arm.  
  
During these early weeks, you’ll want to routinely and gently [reposition your newborn’s head](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/head-turning-dont-miss-this-expert-mamas-essential-newborn-tip/). This stretches the muscles on both sides of their neck to promote flexibility and help prevent Flat Head Syndrome, or plagiocephaly, a condition in which a flat spot develops.

Until your baby can hold their head steady in an upright position, be sure to only use babywearing devices that provide head support. When your baby is in the carrier, keep them positioned with their belly or side against your body and their chin away from their chest to keep their airway open. Once your baby has dynamic head control—meaning they can hold their head steady, even when you move, bend, stop, or turn quickly—they can safely face forward in a carrier, with their back against your body.

## When can babies hold their head up?

Babies develop head control gradually. They typically start to direct their head movements in their third month and gain more control between 4 and 5 months of age. Most have full head control by the time they’re 6 months old.

When a baby is placed on their back just after birth, their head will turn to one side or the other. Within the first two months of life, they’ll likely gain enough neck strength and muscle coordination to both hold their head steady and centered and turn it fully to each side as they lay on their back. In tummy time, they may briefly lift their head slightly and unsteadily—turned to one side or the other—at first, and then begin turning it to the opposite side occasionally. When you hold them upright against your body, they may hold their head up momentarily with a lot of wobbling—and your hand poised to catch it if it falls back.

By 3 or 4 months old, most babies develop the strength and endurance to hold their head up and keep it centered with more steadiness and for longer periods. At this stage, your baby may begin to turn their head toward the sound of a voice.

At 4 to 6 months old, your baby may lift their head high during tummy time and turn it fully to each side with control. Between 5 and 7 months, most babies use intentional head turns when lying down to help them roll from their back to their belly and from their belly to their back.

The final stage is dynamic head control—the ability to keep their head upright even when their body’s position changes. Your baby has gained this level of head control when they can hold their head steady as you lift them from a reclined position. Dynamic head control is essential for your baby to sit up on their own.

## How to help your baby develop head control

Giving your baby plenty of floor time on their back, tummy, and each side is the best way to support their effort to gain head control. This helps build the neck and back muscles needed to lift and control their head. Try these tips:

* Place your baby on their back in [The Play Gym](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-gym), then use visually interesting playthings and sounds to encourage your baby to turn their head as they.
* Lay your baby on your chest, your lap, or the floor to practice tummy time. Hold a high-contrast toy or image directly in front of them, so they try to lift their head.
* With your baby on your lap, momentarily support them at their chest or shoulders to let them practice holding up their head. As they start to develop more strength, you can try supporting them at their waist.
* Hold your baby upright on your shoulder, so they can gaze out a window.

## Activities to encourage head control, stage by stage

### Head control activities for 0 to 3 months

**Seated newborn neck strengthener: 0 to 2 months**

Fill the [Standing Card Holder](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker) with images from the [Simple Black & White Card Set](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker). Secure one end of the card holder to the seat of a chair and drape the other end over the edge. Sit on the floor in front of the chair with your baby on your lap. Hold them in a reclined position, cradling the back of their head, back, and rib cage with one hand. As you raise your baby to a more upright position, hold the thumb and index finger of your free hand in a V shape and use it to support their chin, just enough to prevent their head from flopping forward.

**Tummy time head turner: 0 to 2 months**

After your baby begins to lift their head in tummy time, they’ll work on holding it steady. Next comes moving their head from side to side. To motivate them, place the [Sensory Links](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker) in a semicircle and lay your baby on their tummy in front of it. Squeeze each link to tempt your baby to turn their head toward the sound. Pay attention to their cues. This is hard work and they may tire easily. Any amount of time they practice is progress 🙂

**A new head-lifting angle: 0 to 2 months**

Once your baby can lift their head and hold it centered while lying on their belly, try encouraging them to raise their head even higher.

* Slide a few [Black & White Cards](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker) into the sleeves of the [Standing Card Holder](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker).
* Place one end of the card holder on a chair seat under a cushion, so it hangs vertically from the chair.
* Sit on the floor with your baby’s chest resting on your legs at a slight incline in front of the card holder.
* Direct your baby to the images and describe them.
* If your baby needs a little more help, try gently tucking their arms closer to their body with their elbows bent so their weight rests on their forearms. This will stabilize them and raise them a little higher.

**Head-steadying shoulder hold: 0 to 2 months**

Help your baby practice upright head stability with the [Wooden Book](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker). Open the book to any page and prop it up on a couch. Holding your baby against your chest, sit on the floor with your back against the couch, so they can see the book over your shoulder. Rest a hand behind their head for support. The black-and-white images will engage your baby as they learn to hold up their head and strengthen their neck muscles. You can also do this standing up with the book on a shelf.

**A line-of-sight and neck-muscle stretch: 0 to 2 months**

Slowly moving a high-contrast object, like the [Silicone Rattle With Removable Ball](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker), in front of your baby’s eyes doesn’t just allow them to practice visual tracking. It can also help stretch your baby’s neck muscles. To expand your baby’s visual field, try moving the book in different directions.

### Head control activities for activities for 3 to 6 months

**Follow-the-reflection head rotation: 3 to 4 months**

Place your baby on the floor in tummy time. Hold the [Framed Mirror](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-charmer) just above the floor and move it slowly in a semicircle around your baby, so they turn their head side to side to follow their reflection. This builds their strength for other motor skills they’ll be working on soon, like rolling over. It also may spark some vocalizations—be sure to respond 🩷

**“Gallery” walk: 3 to 4 months**

Give your baby a break from tummy time by going vertical. Use painter’s tape to attach a few high-contrast images from the [Complex Black & White Card Set](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-charmer) to a wall. Hold your baby so they need to look up a little to see the images over your shoulder. As they peruse the “artwork,” they’ll rotate their head, working their neck and shoulder muscles. You can use this as an opportunity to expose them to language, too, by describing what they see.

**Airplane tummy time: 3 to 4 months**

If your baby doesn’t love tummy time on the floor, try playing airplane. Lie on your back in a comfortable place with your baby and bring your knees toward your chest. Holding your baby securely around their torso, rest them on your shins between your knees and ankles. Your baby will likely hold up their head to see their favorite person—you ♥️

## Head control challenges

Most babies develop stable head control by around 5 to 6 months of age. If you have any concerns about your baby’s ability to hold up or move their head, reach out to their pediatrician. Here are a few scenarios that call for an assessment:

* At 2 months, your baby is unable to briefly lift their cheek off the floor during tummy time. Tight muscles on one side of the neck, known as torticollis, causes a baby’s head to consistently turn or tilt in one direction. It can happen for a variety of reasons, but often, it’s brought on by the baby’s position in the womb. Prompt treatment can prevent motor delays.
* Your baby has a distinct preference for turning their head to a particular side when lying on their back. Spending more time lying with their head facing in one direction increases the chance of developing Flat Head Syndrome.
* Your baby isn’t helping to hold their head upright by 4 months of age. While total head control isn’t expected yet, your baby’s head should be much less floppy than it was at 1 to 2 months of age.
