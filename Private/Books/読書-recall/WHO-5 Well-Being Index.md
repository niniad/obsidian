The WHO-5 Well-Being Index is a short, five‑item questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization to assess subjective psychological well‑being. It measures positive mood, vitality, and general interest over the past two weeks and is used worldwide as a screening tool for depression and as an outcome measure in clinical research. The instrument has been translated into more than 30 languages.
