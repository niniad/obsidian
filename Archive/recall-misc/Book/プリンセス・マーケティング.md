プリンセス・マーケティング (Princess Marketing) is a marketing theory that explains the difference between women's and men's consumer behavior. It focuses on the unique psychological aspects of female consumers, emphasizing empathy, storytelling, and the desire for self-improvement. The theory was proposed by Rieko Tanimoto, a sales copywriter. Her book, 『プリンセス・マーケティング 「女性」の購買意欲をかき立てる7つの大原則』 (Princess Marketing: 7 Key Principles to Stimulate Women's Desire to Buy), elaborates on these concepts. The book explains the tendency of women's purchasing psychology by comparing it to men's purchasing psychology.
