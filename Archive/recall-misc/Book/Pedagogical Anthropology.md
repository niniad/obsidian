Pedagogical Anthropology is a work (published circa 1915) that argues for a discipline of "pedagogic anthropology"—an approach that, like general anthropology, begins with observation and positive data, but extends to philosophical conceptions about the future destiny of humanity from a biological perspective. The author envisions a scientific pedagogy that educates physically enhanced humans, positioning pedagogic anthropology as a leading science that could eventually replace criminal anthropology and transform institutions such as prisons and hospitals into schools for the abnormal and feeble.
