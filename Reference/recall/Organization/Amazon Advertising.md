Amazon Advertising is an advertising platform by Amazon that allows advertisers to promote their products and brands both on and off Amazon's sites. It offers various advertising products, including sponsored ads, display ads, and video ads. Advertisers can use these different types of ads to achieve goals such as increasing brand awareness, promoting new products, or increasing sales of existing products. Amazon Advertising uses a pay-per-click model, where advertisers pay when shoppers click on their ads.
