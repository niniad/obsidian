**Wheels made for the way toddlers play**  
Most toy vehicles have static wheels that only move in a straight line. The Wheel Around Town Bus operates like a skateboard, allowing your toddler to make turns by shifting their weight from side to side. This extra level of control over the bus’s movement makes it even more fun to play with while developing your child’s coordination and motor planning.

**Handles for developing muscle strength and balance**  
Since children tend to grasp the tops of vehicles to move them around, we added handles on each side of the bus. Instead of pushing the bus with one hand, your child needs to get above or behind the bus to move it, encouraging them to move all the large muscles in their body and develop better balance.

**Sorting and color recognition, made fun**  
The Wheel Around Town Bus comes with three colorful peg people that your toddler can match to their corresponding seats and post into place. Matching requires color recognition, sorting, and categorization, all early math skills. Posting gives your toddler a chance to practice their fine motor skills.

The Wheel Around Town Bus from [The Realist Play Kit](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-realist) comes with three peg people for functional play.

**Imitating real life through play**  
Your toddler may also be interested in using the colorful peg people to recreate scenes from everyday life. They can walk the peg people up the steps of the bus, place them in seats, and take them on a ride. This early form of pretend play is an opportunity for them to learn new vocabulary and build social-emotional skills with you ❤️
