## Steps for removing the current backsplash:

1. Remove the water tank from the back panel of The Real Life Play Kitchen.
2. Four screws attach the cleat holding the water tank to the kitchen panel. Use a screwdriver to unscrew them from the panel.
3. The shelf is attached to the wall with two screws. Remove the shelf from the panel using an Allen wrench.
4. To remove the original backsplash, lift one corner and gently pull it away from the panel. Keep peeling until the entire backsplash has been removed.
5. Set the backsplash aside, being careful to lay it flat so it doesn’t crumple. The backsplash can be saved to use again later.

## Steps for attaching the new backsplash:

1. Find the new backsplash decal of your choice. Lay it flat, pattern side down. Remove only the center strip of backing.
2. Line up the new backsplash with the panel of the kitchen. Align it with the plastic lip at the bottom.
3. Ensure that the backslash is lined up with the edges, shelf openings, and holes for the screws.
4. Once the backsplash is aligned, press down securely on the center sticky strip to adhere it to the panel.
5. Fold the side of the decal toward the middle and remove the backing. Slowly push the decal sticker down, pressing toward the outside edge.
6. Repeat step 5 on the other side. Press any bubbles toward the edge to make sure the decal sticker is fully adhered.
7. Reattach the cleat and shelf to the panel using the screws.
8. Reattach the water tank to the cleat to hold it in place.

**Helpful tip:** You can use the backing from the new backsplash to save the previous decal. Simply adhere it to the sticky side of the previous decal and store it flat.
