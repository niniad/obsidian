1. A variety of materials to paint on, like construction paper, textured cardstock, cardboard, cellophane, fabric scraps, aluminum foil, bubble wrap, etc.

**Description:**

1. Tape a few materials of varying textures onto a table so they overlap like a mosaic.
2. Give your toddler a couple paint sticks and use simple language to describe each surface as they color: “Bumpy, bumpy, bumpy, smoooooth, shiny.”
3. Demonstrate back-and-forth and circular scribbles as you introduce more words, like, “Scribble, scribble, scribble” and “Round and round. ”
4. If your child prefers to make small marks across the paper, follow their lead and “dot, dot, dot” along.
5. Notice and talk about how the paint interacts with each unique surface.
