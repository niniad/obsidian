Of all the [play schemas](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/what-are-play-schemas-and-how-do-they-help-your-toddler-learn/) your toddler explores, the “trajectory” schema may be your least favorite 🙃 Children learn so much about the physical world by [throwing, dropping, rolling, and flinging things](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/throwing-and-rolling-and-flinging-oh-my/)—including their own body. It can get a little bit annoying, but there are ways to redirect this kind of schema play to make it less destructive.

## 3 ways to support your toddler’s trajectory schema

**1. Give them better things to [throw](https://blog.lovevery.com/skills-stages/throwing/).** If your toddler is throwing food, rocks, sand, or something else inappropriate, redirect them to items like light scarves, soft balls, light plastic balls, small bean bags, or a small stuffed animal.

**2. Let them [play with water](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/art-science-and-fine-motor-water-play-checks-all-the-boxes/)\*** Set up a baby pool outdoors and give your toddler cups and other objects to throw in to make a splash. They can also pour water into the tub or kitchen sink from a cup or small pitcher. Even a simple water sensory tray works well, with a few pouring tools.

**3. Give them fun ways to move their body.** Part of the trajectory schema is exploring the way their own body moves, so provide your toddler with opportunities to tumble, roll, jump, crawl, bounce, swing, and more.

**\*Note:** Please supervise your toddler at all times around water, as it’s possible for them to drown in less than 1 inch of water.
