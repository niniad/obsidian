We tend to think of baths as a calming experience, but that isn’t true for every toddler. Your child may be afraid of anything from getting soap in their eyes to being sucked down the drain. Bath time also involves a lot of sensory stimulation—the feeling of water that’s a bit too cold or warm and the sound of splashing or echoes bouncing off the walls can be overwhelming for some toddlers.

It’s easy to doubt yourself when your child hides when it’s time to get in the bath or yells through the process. Remember, you don’t need to bathe your toddler every day—just a couple times a week is plenty.

## Tips to make bath time easier for you and your toddler

### Act out bath time during play

Pretend to bathe toys together using a bin of soapy water and a washcloth. You could bathe a baby doll, a toy animal, or even a plastic truck. Go through the steps of washing each part of the toy, rinsing off, and then getting out of the “tub.” Your toddler can get used to the bath time routine in a low-pressure environment.

### Do lots of water play

Create positive associations with water by doing water play outside of the bath. Try placing a shallow tray with water on the floor or a low table in front of them and add the [Grooved Pitcher and Glass](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-realist) or the animals in the [Montessori Animal Match](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-companion) for them to explore. A few measuring spoons from the kitchen for scooping or a few squeezes of bath soap to make bubbles can add to the fun.

### Tone down the sensory input

Try dimming the lights and talking in a soft voice during bath time. Before your toddler gets into the bath, you can both touch the water from outside of the tub so they can get used to the temperature and the feel.

### Consider a different time of day

While evening baths work for some children, they can be too stimulating for others. Bathing them earlier in the day, when they aren’t expected to fall asleep afterward, may be a better move. You also may have more energy and patience to help them through a tough bath.

### Acknowledge their fears

Let your toddler know you understand their apprehension: “I can see that you’re having a hard time with the bath. Daddy is right here with you.” Talk them through each step and offer words of reassurance: “I’m going to pour water on your back now. It’s nice and warm.”

### Change the mood

Try singing a song, acting silly, or making funny noises to put them at ease. Make a few bath toys “jump” off the side of the bath and go for a swim. You can also have the washcloth wash a few toys before it washes your toddler. A playful mood may take some of the stress out of bath time for both of you.

Note: Please closely supervise your toddler at all times around water, as it’s possible for them to drown in less than 1 inch of water.
