# Welcome to The Realist Play Kit for months 19-21

Source: https://blog.lovevery.com/product-recommendations/welcome-to-the-realist-play-kit-for-months-19-21/

Now that your toddler is a year and a half old, there are so many new skills beginning to emerge: two-word phrases like “Mommy go?”, feeling (and demonstrating) a wider range of emotions, and a desire to help around the house. You may catch them singing to themselves, understanding much more of what you say, and paying closer attention to colors—even perhaps showing preferences.

[The Realist Play Kit](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-realist) is packed full of just-right playthings and activities for your one-and-a-half-year-old. Among them is the Quilted Critter Pockets. One way to play is to hang the pockets holder on a doorknob or wall and put the critters in a basket on the floor. Your child will work to squat, pick a critter, stand up, pull open the pocket and put in the animal plush. This helps to build muscles and, by matching a critter to its appropriate pocket, strengthen cognition.

There’s tons more in the Realist, from numbers play to practice with pouring—and another exciting new puzzle—for you and your child to explore together, supported as always by our informative and research-based Play Guide.
