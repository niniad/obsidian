The sink, the tub, a hose on low drip, a tray on the floor—there are so many ways to play with water and babies love them all!

Your baby also loves to play with ice. They’re starting to learn that some things stay the same, some things appear to change but are actually still the same (like you in your 😎), and some things actually transform—like ice melting to water.

*As a reminder: Closely supervise your baby at all times around water and ice. Small pieces of ice can present a choking hazard, and water can be a drowning hazard even at depths of less than 1 inch.*

## Here are some ideas for water and ice play:

* Let your baby play with large ice cubes as they melt and slide around on a cookie sheet or tray.
* While your baby is in a warm bath, put a few ice cubes in so they can work to grasp them before they melt. A drop or two of food coloring in your ice tray is fun, too.

* The bathroom sink can be fun too because they can play with you and the baby in the mirror 😉
* You can put your baby in your kitchen sink with the tap on warm and low. Your baby will enjoy the feel of the smooth hardware and dripping water.

* Once your baby is sitting reliably (and if weather allows), you can take them outside with you and put them on the grass, deck, or patio with a large bowl of water and the [Nesting Stacking Dripdrop Cups](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-inspector).

* Fill a sealable bag with large ice cubes and tape it to the floor. Let your baby feel the shape of the cubes and the icy cold texture.⁣
