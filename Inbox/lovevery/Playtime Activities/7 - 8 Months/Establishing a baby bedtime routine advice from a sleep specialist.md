A simple and brief bedtime routine for your baby is ideal. It should only include a few elements and last no more than 10 to 15 minutes. This way, you can follow the routine anywhere and another caregiver can easily replicate it.

## Bath or no bath?

Baths are a common part of bedtime rituals, and if they work for your baby, there’s no reason to stop. Some babies, as they grow older, become too aroused or even upset by the sensory experience of the bath. If this is the case for your baby, consider bathing them less frequently or earlier in the day.

## Try this simple nighttime routine

1. It might seem early, but putting your baby to bed between 6:30 and 7 p.m. helps them get the sleep they need.
2. Change your baby’s diaper and put them in pajamas and a sleep sack.
3. [Read one or two short books](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/it-can-last-less-than-a-minute-but-makes-a-big-difference/).
4. Turn off the lights, close the blinds or pull the shades, and consider turning on white noise like a fan or sound machine.
5. Cuddle your baby while singing a [short song](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/lyrics-to-the-best-lullabies-are-here/) like ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.’
6. Place your baby in their crib and say good night ❤️

Note: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that a sound machine should be set no louder than 50 decibels, about the sound level of a quiet dishwasher. Place it well away from your baby’s crib and use a low-volume setting.
