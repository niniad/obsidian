### Discover different sounds

Each Wooden Sound Cylinder makes a unique noise when shaken or rolled. This gives your baby a fun way to practice telling two sounds apart, a skill child development experts call “auditory discrimination.” Practicing this skill helps your baby hear the distinct sounds within words, an important part of understanding language and learning to speak.
