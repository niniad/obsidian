Watching our babies grow is one of the best parts of parenting: first smiles, words, and steps are moments many of us remember for the rest of our lives. There are also subtler [baby milestones](https://blog.lovevery.com/podcast/babys-first-steps-walking-and-other-milestones/), like when your baby begins reacting to music or uses their tongue to move food around in their mouth. All milestones, big and small, are important to your child’s development ❤️ Read how [Lovevery toys help with your baby’s development](https://lovevery.com/pages/baby-toys) to reach these milestones.

## What are infant and baby milestones?

Developmental milestones are skills and behaviors your baby will develop as they grow, and are divided by ages or age ranges. Milestones are typically grouped into the following categories:

* **Motor skills (gross and fine)** refer to your child’s physical development. Gross motor skills involve larger muscles in the body, and include sitting up, walking, and kicking. Fine motor skills involve the smaller muscles needed for grasping, squeezing, or cutting with scissors.
* **Cognition** refers to your child’s brain development, including the ability to think, reason, learn, and problem-solve.
* **Language & communication** include both receptive and expressive language. Receptive language is what your child can hear and understand, and expressive language is what they can say. Much of language development in the early years is pre-verbal.
* **Social emotional** development refers to your child’s understanding of emotions—both their own and those of others around them.

Milestones are meant as guides rather than strict barometers of developmental “success.” Developmental windows—periods of time during which your child is primed to learn a new skill—are flexible and variable. They depend on a number of factors, including interest and temperament. Disabilities and developmental delays can also impact when and if a child reaches a particular milestone.

\*Note: unless otherwise noted, the skills mentioned in this article are first listed at the *beginning* of a developmental window; it may be another few weeks or even months before you see the described behavior or skill, and some skills may be skipped altogether. Keep in mind that these are ranges, not averages. For example, babies usually start walking between 9 and 18 months, but the [*average*](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/walking-by-their-first-birthday-not-on-average/) is 13-15 months.

### How are milestones measured?

Milestones include both the broad skills your child acquires, and the smaller incremental steps involved in learning them. For example, the age range for starting to walk is [broad](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/walking-by-their-first-birthday-not-on-average/)—between 9 and 18 months—and there are many smaller skills your child learns along the way. These include pulling up to stand, cruising (walking while holding onto furniture), and falling intentionally into a sitting position.

Overlap between developmental categories is common, especially in young babies. Smiling, for example, is related to both fine motor and social emotional skills. Abilities in the cognitive category, in particular, are intertwined with other areas of development.

### Do all babies hit milestones at the same time?

The short answer is no. Every child is unique and will follow their own developmental path. Milestones are useful gauges of a child’s growth, but the ranges provided below are not meant to be exhaustive or definitive. Most babies gain certain skills within a short amount of time, but other skills may take months or even years to acquire.

Check with your child’s pediatrician if you are concerned about a delay, or are worried that you aren’t seeing progress where you expected it. Early interventions are often simple, and can be the most effective way to support your child’s long-term development.

“I encourage parents to cultivate *curiosity* instead of worry,” says Pediatric Occupational Therapist Rachel Coley. “Ask yourself how other skills in the same area of development are going. Have they been a little later to emerge than the books say? Did Baby skip some of those skills?”

When is it time to approach a doctor? Coley says, “I encourage parents to discuss all developmental concerns with their pediatrician, but generally I lean toward the proactive approach of early intervention if there is an area of development (or several) with multiple lagging milestones—or if there isn’t progress toward a major milestone by the end of the expected age range.”

### What about milestones and premature babies?

Generally speaking, premature babies (born before 37 weeks of gestation) reach milestones according to their due date rather than their birth date. If your child was born 8 weeks early, their developmental path is more likely to match a baby born 8 weeks later; this is known as “adjusted age” or “corrected age.” Use your child’s adjusted age when looking at milestones.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, most premature babies have caught up to those born at full term by age 2.
