Around 7-9 months, babies begin to notice that some things are malleable—they start out one shape and then can be changed into another.

Here are super simple ways to show how everyday items can transform:

* Crumple a sheet of paper in front of your baby
* Tear a sheet of paper in half and then show how the pieces fit back together again
* Cut a sheet of foil and crumple it into a ball
* Lay a dish towel, napkin, or blanket out flat in front of your baby, and then scrunch it up or stuff it into a [treasure basket](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-inspector)
* Show your baby a cracker and break it in half
* If you have dough or modeling clay, roll out logs and then squish them into balls
