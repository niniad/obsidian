# Why it’s great to let your baby struggle with the Ball Drop Box

At first, your baby will probably not be able to get the ball into the [Ball Drop Box](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-inspector). It takes a lot of practice and coordination. Watch as baby Eric takes the challenge!

Here are some ways to get started:

* Show your baby the ball, name it, then drop the ball into the Ball Drop Box in your baby’s view so that the ball quickly disappears, then reappears.
* Help them try; if the ball misses the hole, see if they reach to try and get it.
* Resist getting the ball for your baby right away—reaching across their body while sitting helps them develop balance and gross motor skills.
* Your baby is practicing grasping and releasing on purpose as they try to drop the ball in the box (a skill they will continue to develop throughout their first year).
* Have them experiment with the wood and felt balls. The [wood ball](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-inspector) reliably comes out of the box and makes a loud noise, while the felt ball doesn’t make a sound and sometimes stays hidden in the box.
