Just when you think your baby is sleeping through the night, they may experience a sleep regression. Suddenly, you could notice them get fussier at bedtime, wake up more frequently, or have more difficulty falling back to sleep.

## Why your baby’s sleep is disrupted

As challenging as a sleep regression can be, exciting growth is often taking place at the same time. Your baby may be more alert when they’re awake, learning to crawl, or even getting new teeth 🙃 This growth can mean they’re more susceptible to getting overstimulated, which makes falling and staying asleep more difficult.

Sleep regressions aren’t always caused by developmental shifts, however. Illnesses and changes to their routine or environment can also be to blame.

## Don’t worry, it won’t last forever

If your baby’s sleep disruptions are the result of an intense period of growth, they should start sleeping through the night again before too long—typically between 3 to 6 weeks. In the meantime, here are a few ideas to help:

1. **Assess their naps.** Your baby may be ready to sleep less during the day. For example, if they take 3 naps, you might try letting go of the last one to improve nighttime sleep. Conversely, if they aren’t napping well, being overtired may cause sleep disruptions at night. To help them nap better, try putting them to sleep in their crib and making their room darker.
2. **Keep it consistent at bedtime.** Research shows that a predictable [bedtime routine](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/beyond-the-bedtime-routine-why-everyday-rituals-are-important-for-your-babys-brain/) can help babies fall asleep and minimize nighttime wakeups.
3. **Prepare them for sleep.** Help them relax and get drowsy by [reading a book](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/it-can-last-less-than-a-minute-but-makes-a-big-difference/), playing music, or giving them a bath before bedtime.

If your baby still isn’t sleeping well after an extended period of time or you have additional concerns, consult your baby’s pediatrician.
