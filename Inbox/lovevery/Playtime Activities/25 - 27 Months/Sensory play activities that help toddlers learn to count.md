“One, two, four, six, TEN!” When your toddler recites numbers in order—whether or not they’re accurate—they’re developing their math vocabulary. But there’s something even more interesting going on at around age 2: They’re starting to understand each number word represents a **quantity**. For example, if they put up two fingers, they might get two yummy waffles for breakfast 😉

## Why learning about quantity is tricky**—**and how you can help

When your toddler learns the word “ball,” they are connecting a word with an object they can see and interact with. In contrast, number words like “three” and “four” are abstract—instead of describing one thing, they can describe many things.Hearing you say, “Here are three balls,” followed by, “Look, there are three squirrels” may be confusing to your child initially. The balls and squirrels have nothing—shape, size, or color—in common. Your child has to learn that the number word is what applies to both. This is how they begin to pay attention to quantity.

## 15 sensory activities that support your child’s growing math skills

Cognitive science researcher and STEM expert, Jennifer Weeks, Ph.D., says drawing your child’s attention to quantity using their senses can help them to more quickly understand the abstract concept:
