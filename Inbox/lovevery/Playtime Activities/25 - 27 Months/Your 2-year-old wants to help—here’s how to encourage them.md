Does your 2-year-old love to help set the table or take laundry out of the dryer? Up until now, they were likely driven by a desire to imitate you or accomplish a task on their own. But research shows that around 2 years of age, your child may start to pick up on another person’s feelings and want to help out of empathy—for example, they may offer a jacket to someone who is shivering or says they’re cold. This is an important shift that signals your child’s growing ability to notice and respond to the needs of others.

## 3 ways to encourage your child’s empathetic helping

### 1. Bring their attention to the needs and feelings of others

You might say, “It looks like your sister can’t reach her jacket, should we ask if we can be a helper?” or “Kitten’s water bowl is empty. Let’s fill it up for her.” Research suggests that doing this frequently helps children develop perspective taking—the ability to see the world through another’s eyes.

### 2. Acknowledge when they do a good deed

Thank them and explain how their helpful actions make an impact. For example, you could say, “Thank you so much for picking up the glasses I dropped. I can see better now.” Or, “You gave your baby brother his pacifier when he was sad. That made him feel better! Thank you.”

### 3. Adjust your expectations for what “helpful” looks like

Your 2-year-old’s task assistance may not always be useful—when they try to water a plant, the floor might get wet. Their attempts at empathetic helping will likely encounter similar hiccups. For example, if you’re sick, they may bring you *their* favorite stuffy to cuddle. Smile and thank them anyway ❤️
