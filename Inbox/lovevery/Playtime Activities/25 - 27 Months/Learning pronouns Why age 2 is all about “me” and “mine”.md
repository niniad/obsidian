You’ll know when your child’s “mine” phase begins 😉

Whether they’re grabbing a toy and exclaiming “mine” for the first—or the hundredth—time, it can feel uncomfortable, especially around other people. But this doesn’t mean your 2-year-old is selfish. They’re beginning to use pronouns, an important part of [speech](https://blog.lovevery.com/skills-stages/talking-language-development/) that helps them communicate ownership and understand their identity.

## Learning pronouns is a process—and mix-ups are common

Understanding that “me” is another name for themselves is a big socio-cognitive leap for your 2-year-old. They have to grasp that “me” and “you” are names that transfer depending on who is speaking—unlike Mommy who is always “Mommy” or their friend Jack who is always “Jack.” Many toddlers may point to their chest and say “you” or their own name until they’ve learned “I” and “me.”

The mix-ups will likely continue as your child learns more advanced pronouns. They might use phrases like, “I got it me-self!” or “Her did that!” These minor errors work themselves out with time and experience. Your child may not use all forms of pronouns until age 5 and use inaccurate pronouns into elementary school. Instead of correcting, just model the right words: “Oh, she did that? I wonder why!”

## 3 easy ways to practice pronouns

### 1. Say, “Yes, that is yours”

When your child says “Mine!” or “My water” to claim it as theirs, reinforce their use of personal pronouns with: “Yes! That is your water bottle.” Then use the moment to build their pronoun knowledge by modeling a few more: “This bottle is mine. Where’s Papa’s bottle? There it is! That one is his**.**”

### 2. Ask “Where, oh where?”

“Where, oh where, oh where is Charlie? There **you** are! Where, oh where, oh where is Nana? There **she** is.” After finding Nana, try finding her shoe: “Where, oh where, oh where is her shoe? There **it** is.”

### 3. Play a turn-taking game

Pull a dot from the **[Drop & Match Dot Catcher](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-helper)** bag and put it in the matching column. Then have your toddler try. Models phrases like, “Your turn,” “My turn,” and “I got a blue one. What color will you get? You got green!”
