It may not always seem obvious, but your two-year-old *does* have an attention span 😉 Exactly how long it is depends on a wide range of factors, but generally speaking, a two-and-a-half-year-old child can focus on a specific toy or activity for around four minutes. By the age of five, children are expected to have an attention span of at least 15 minutes to be successful when they start school.

Focus is a skill that needs to be taught and practiced. Here’s how to help build your two-year-old’s focus:

### **Reframe what focus looks like**

Focus may look different as your child develops, and can even seem to fluctuate from day to day. Sometimes, for example, your child might be able to calmly listen to a story while sitting on your lap. Other times they may bounce around, play, and fiddle with their toys. The good news is, they are receiving the same level of language exposure either way; they benefit just as much from squirming and listening as they do from sitting still and listening.

Do look for cues during moments of restlessness (like [whining](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/kids-whine-because-it-works/) or clinginess) that can tell you when your child is actually in need of your support or a break. A child who moves between different activities during their play could be communicating that they are overstimulated, bored, or looking for connection with you.

### **Not too easy, not too hard**

Offering toys that meet the current developmental needs and interests of your two-year-old can develop your child’s ability to focus.

The [Drop & Match Dot Catcher](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-helper) is a good example of an activity that offers just the right amount of challenge. You may need to help your child with the color-matching element, but they are more likely to stay engaged because they can experiment with dropping in the dots and sliding the tab to release them on their own.

A [pretend sink](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-helper) combines water play (always a favorite 🙂) with your child’s interest in mimicking a practical life activity they see you doing every day. It may also lead to some intriguing questions about how things work: “where is the water coming from?” See other [learning toys for 2-year olds](https://lovevery.com/pages/toys-for-two-year-olds) from Lovevery.

### **There’s a sweet spot for “focus coaching”**

A study by the National Institutes of Health found that young children developed a greater capacity for focus when they had gentle and limited support from their adult caregivers. Think about it as “focus coaching”—focus has to be taught and practiced.

Tasks requiring too much adult control, however, were counterproductive to the child’s ability to focus. Finding the right balance can be tricky, and may require some trial and error to determine how much support your child truly needs.

When you are playing with your two-year-old and notice them struggling with something, wait before stepping in to see if they can find a solution on their own first. If they’re disengaging from a challenging [puzzle](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-helper), for example, you can point and say “I see a yellow, round piece that I bet would fit where the sun is.” If they still seem lost, you can put the piece right next to its slot on the puzzle board and let your child slide it into place. Then say, “can you try doing the next piece?”

### **Consider a minimalist approach**

In the Montessori philosophy, less is more. Two-year-olds are in a developmental stage Montessori experts refer to as the “sensitive period for order.” Having too many toys to choose from can overwhelm your two-year-old and make it harder for them to focus.

Consider incorporating [toy rotation](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/rotating-toys-the-montessori-way-better-deeper-play/) into your routine. By limiting the number of toys your child has access to, you can tailor what is available to meet their current interests and abilities, allowing them to deepen their focus without environmental distractions.
