A lot of sensory activities focus on texture, temperature, and other tactile properties. Here are a few ways to incorporate scent into your 2-year-old’s play.

## DIY spice paints

Gather a few ground spices in concentrated pigments, like turmeric, paprika, nutmeg, cinnamon, and rosemary.

Put a tablespoon of the spice into a small bowl or cup and add just enough water to make a paste. The amount of water you add may vary from spice to spice based on the texture and how translucent or opaque you want the paint to be.

Note: Some spice powders can stain, so consider protecting clothes and surfaces, and wash your child’s hands after the activity is finished.

## Nature soup

Collect aromatics like sliced lemons and limes, orange peels, mint leaves or other fresh herbs like sage or thyme.

Combine these ingredients in a large mixing bowl or sensory bin. Then, invite your child to pour water from the Grooved Pitcher ([The Realist Play Kit](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-realist)) into the bowl or bin and stir with a whisk or slotted spoon. The more your child mixes, the stronger the scent.

Some 2-year-olds are beginning to engage in more pretend play. Follow their lead if they invite you to help them “serve” or “cook” the soup.

## Cut and compare fruits

Start by smelling whole and cut up fruits and compare them with your child. Are some of the fruits easier to smell than others? A peach, for example, smells stronger than an apple. Consider buying a few types of fruit you don’t usually eat to explore at home.

## Coffee bean sensory bin

Pour the coffee beans into a large shallow container and add scoops, tweezers, and a scale.

If the coffee smell is too strong for either you or your child, consider other scented sensory bins. You can add lemon zest to dried rice or a few drops of peppermint oil to some water.

Always keep a close eye on your child while they play with these bins, especially if they’re still likely to put things in their mouth. To prevent food waste, you can thoroughly rinse the coffee beans or wash and cook the rice after play is done.
