# Welcome to The Helper Play Kit for months 25-27

Source: https://blog.lovevery.com/product-recommendations/welcome-to-the-helper-play-kit-for-months-25-27/

We can’t wait to welcome you and your child into their third year with the best stage-based support. You’ve probably seen signs of your child pursuing independence and exploring the push and pull between “baby” and “big kid.”

At 25, 26 and 27 months, your child may start to draw with more controlled movements, have a favorite book they want to hear over and over, test limits, and show early signs of executive function.

That’s where [The Helper](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-helper) comes in. Each of the seven innovative Playthings in The Helper Play Kit was designed, tested, and perfected so you and your family can explore during this stage. They’ll help your child count, separate, understand routines, plan ahead, rhyme, build spatial awareness and so much more.

You won’t find them anywhere else, and we can’t wait to share them with you.

Be sure to check out the Play Guide that comes with The Helper, too. It’s full of developmental information, activity ideas, and suggestions for supporting your child’s play.
