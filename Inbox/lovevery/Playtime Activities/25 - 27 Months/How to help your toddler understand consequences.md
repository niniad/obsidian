Your toddler looks you straight in the eye and throws a cracker to the floor. The cracker breaks into pieces and their tears start to flow. While throwing a cracker they wanted to eat may seem irrational, it’s a sign that your toddler is learning about **[consequences](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/how-to-give-your-2-year-old-logical-consequences/)**.

## Helping your 2-year-old understand consequences starts with making predictions

At age 2, your child may be able to predict what will happen if they throw their cracker. For example, they may realize it will fall to the floor. But they might not consider that the cracker could break or be eaten by the dog 🙃 By age 4, your child may have a broader understanding of potential consequences and be able to stop themselves from throwing the cracker—but they need practice to get there. Here’s how to help:

## 3 ways to help your child make better predictions

### 1. Ask, “What might happen?”

If your child is about to make an unwise decision, like running on a slippery sidewalk, try asking them, “Hmmm, what might happen if you run on the ice?” If they don’t respond, you can answer your own question: “I think you might fall down. That would hurt. The ice makes the sidewalk slippery. Let’s walk carefully.”

### 2. Use the word “made”

Research shows that using causal language—like the word “made”—may help children connect an action to a result. Here are some examples:

* ”Throwing your stuffed animal **made** it hard to reach”
* ”Smashing your toy **made** it break”
* ”The bumpy ground **made** you trip and fall”
* “Hitting your brother **made** him cry”

### 3. Explain what they could have done differently

For example, “Lifting your plate made it tilt, then the food fell off. Keeping your plate on the table will help the food stay in place.” The point of this strategy is not to blame your child, but simply help them understand why an event happened the way it did. Over time, this can help them predict a consequence in a similar situation—and potentially avoid a mishap.
