One of the best ways to support children who are afraid of the dark is to reveal what’s hidden inside of it. Fear of the dark is normal; we are afraid of what we can’t see, especially when we’re young and so much of the world is still unknown to us. A scavenger hunt with a flashlight is a great way to look for fun, friendly, familiar items with a beam of light—and works great for kids who aren’t afraid of the dark too 🔦

## Here’s how to do a flashlight scavenger hunt:

* If you haven’t introduced your child to a flashlight yet, now is a great time to do it. Teach them the most important rule: we never shine a flashlight into anyone’s eyes (including our own). Show them how to turn it on and off, and how to hold it the right way. The Really Real Flashlight that comes in our [Realist Play Kit](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-realist) offers a gentle, muted light that’s just right for little ones learning the ropes.

* Find a dark space—your child’s room works well, or anywhere they are very familiar with. Turn off the lights and sit together in the dark (the darker the better), and shine the flashlight beam towards something familiar (crib, dresser, changing table).
* After you’ve shown a few items, hand the flashlight to your child: it’s their turn to look! Pick another easy-to-find object and ask them point to the beam until they can find it.
* If you have the time and energy, hide some fun objects around the room ahead of time. Place a well-loved stuffy somewhere on a shelf, tape some colorful paper to the wall, and hang something bright from the ceiling.
* If you have older kids, this is also a wonderful way to practice certain academic drills in a fun way. For kids learning sight words or math facts, for example, tape a few of them to the wall in various places, and when your child finds them with the flashlight, have ask them to read the word or solve the problem.
