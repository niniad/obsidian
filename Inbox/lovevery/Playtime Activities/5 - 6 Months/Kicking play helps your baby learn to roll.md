Your baby is figuring out that their legs and feet are **parts of their body**. When they kick, they start to understand that their body can create noise or movement.

They are also building important neck strength by tucking their chin to look down at their legs and feet. This **“chin tuck”** helps build strength for [rolling over](https://blog.lovevery.com/skills-stages/rolling/) from back to side, and then eventually from back to belly.

### Here are some fun ideas for kicking play:

**Encourage kicking with textures and sound**

Wedge the edge of some tissue paper under a couch cushion for your baby to kick while lying on their back. The crinkling texture of the tissue paper will encourage them to repeat the sounds and sensations.

**Pair kicking with sensory input**  
With your baby lying on their back, dangle one of the [Sensory Links](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker) near their feet using the included S-hooks. Show them how they can make crinkle or rattle noises by touching the Sensory Links with their feet.

**Give them space to move and kick freely**  
Place them on their back with their feet over the Making Sounds Zone of [The Play Gym](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-gym) so that they can build strength and motor skills as they kick their feet to make different sounds.
