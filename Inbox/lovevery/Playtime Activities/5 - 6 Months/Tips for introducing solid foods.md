## How to know if your baby is ready for solid foods—and 5 tips for getting started

At around 6 months, most babies are ready to start solid foods. This early stage is about learning how to eat and enjoy new tastes and textures. Until age 1, most of your baby’s nutrition will still come from breast milk and/or formula.

### 3 signs your baby is ready for solids

Because every baby develops at their own pace, it’s important to look for signs of solid food readiness, even if they are 6 months old. There are three signs to look for:

1. Mouthing toys with infrequent gagging
2. Starting to show interest in food and mealtimes
3. Sitting upright with just a little help for balance

Note: Many babies who are unable to sit upright can begin solids with extra support for posture in their high chair or feeding seat. So if you aren’t seeing this sign by 7 months, ask your baby’s pediatrician for their assessment of your child’s readiness for solids.

### Tips for introducing solids

No matter what feeding method you choose—traditional purees, [baby-led weaning](https://blog.lovevery.com/podcast/perspectives-on-feeding-baby-led-weaning/), or a mix of both—here are some tips to help you get started. Need more advice? Check out our expert course, “[The Food Before 1 Course Pack](https://lovevery.com/products/the-food-before-1-course-pack).”

**Time it right.** Your baby’s first introductions to solids tend to go better if your baby is well-rested—and even well fed. Solid foods should not replace feedings at this stage, so if your baby is hungry, offer breast milk or formula. These early tastings are about exploring flavor and texture.

**Once a day is okay.** For the first couple of months, aim to offer solids one or two times a day. When starting solids, many babies are napping up to three times per day and nursing or taking a bottle frequently. It can be tricky to fit solid food into their daily rhythms, so stay flexible. It’s okay if they only eat solid foods once a day in the beginning. As they approach their first birthday, you can establish a more structured schedule of three meals a day.

**Let them determine the quantity.** At this stage, your baby should decide how much they eat. There’s a wide range in how much solid food babies eat—there is no single “right” amount.

**Watch their posture.** To reduce the risk of choking, be sure your baby is sitting upright, not leaning backward or slumping forward.

**Prepare for a mess 😉.** Touching food and trying to feed themselves are important mealtime experiences for your baby, but this can be messy. Be prepared with supplies like bibs, wipes, placemats, and floor covers. It can be tempting to use mess-minimizing shortcuts like feeding your baby every bite or letting them eat directly from a baby food pouch. Try to do that in moderation so your baby has time to learn and explore.

**Follow your baby’s lead.** If the process of introducing solids gets frustrating, your baby may be giving you a sign that they’re not interested right now. If they cry, look away, or refuse to take a bite, stop and try again another time.

### What foods are best to start with?

While new parents were once advised to start with rice cereal, there’s no scientific reason you need to start that way. These days, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) acknowledges a [range of options for nutrient-dense first foods](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Starting-Solid-Foods.aspx).

**Puree foods with breast milk or formula**: Use breast milk, formula, low-sodium broth, or water when pureeing fruits, vegetables, and meats. You don’t need to worry about the order of foods introduced, but do wait a couple of days before introducing the next new food.

**Soft finger foods**: You can introduce mashable soft solids in small pieces or thin strips for finger-feeding. Chop small pieces no bigger than 1/2″ thick, wide or long. Slice thin strips no longer than 2″ and no more than 1/2″ thick or wide. All first solids should be soft enough for you to mash easily between your thumb and index finger. A banana, well-cooked apple and sweet potato are all great options.

**Extra iron:** Exclusively or primarily breastfed babies in particular need external sources of iron at around 6 months of age. Regularly include iron-rich foods in your baby’s solid food meals, such as mashed or pureed beans, pureed meat, and pureed spinach. Studies show that serving foods rich in vitamin C—like strawberries, broccoli, and potatoes—supports iron absorption.

### Safety considerations when introducing solids

**Stay close and attentive.** Caregiver supervision is one of the most effective ways to reduce your baby’s risk of choking. Though choking is unlikely, it is best for you and any caregiver who will supervise your baby’s mealtimes to be trained in infant CPR and First Aid.

**Consult your baby’s doctor** if there’s a family history of food allergies and/or your baby has moderate to severe eczema.

**Introduce common allergens early and often** if your baby does not have severe eczema and there’s no family history of food allergies. Common allergens include peanuts, fish, shellfish, eggs, sesame, soy, and wheat. Allergens should be offered one by one, waiting three to five days between each. Most reactions—like rash, vomiting, and diarrhea—will occur within 24 hours of exposure.

## When to give your baby their own spoon

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.lovevery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Month7_TipGraphic_4.11.22.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&ssl=1)

Learning to use a spoon is a big step on your baby’s path to self-feeding. Once they can grasp a toy and bring it to their mouth, usually by the time they start solids, they should be ready to try using a spoon to put food in their own mouth.

Introducing a spoon as soon as your baby starts eating solid foods promotes independence, motor skills, sensory perception, and speech. They may also be more willing to try new foods if they have control and get to experiment with a spoon.

Even with an early start, many babies don’t get good control of this skill until 9 months of age or after. Independent eating with a spoon takes practice. Surrender to the mess—it’s all part of the learning process 🙃

### 8 tips for introducing a spoon

1. Use a baby-size spoon. Montessori experts suggest using a metal, baby-sized version of a spoon that resembles full-size utensils. Stainless steel is also eco-friendly and dishwasher safe.
2. Start by modeling how **you** eat from a spoon, eating the same food your baby is eating. Slowly and deliberately demonstrate how you scoop the food onto the spoon from your bowl, open your mouth wide and bring the spoon to your mouth. Slowly close your lips over the spoon and swallow.
3. Try two spoons at first: one for you to use to feed your baby and another for your baby to use to self-feed. This allows them to practice the fine motor skills involved while you make sure a few tastes make it into their mouth.
4. After a few meals, teach your baby how to eat from a preloaded spoon: dip the spoon into a puree, then show them how to bring it to their mouth. Let your baby hold onto your hand so they can see how it feels.
5. Preload the spoon again, then put it back in the bowl for your baby to pick up. Center the spoon handle atop the edge of the bowl in front of your child so they can decide which hand to use.
6. Don’t worry if your baby ends up putting the wrong side of the spoon in their mouth or misses their mouth altogether.
7. Try to keep mealtimes free of distractions so your baby can focus on eating.

## Hand-to-mouth discovery

Your child might not be ready to pull the linked tissues out of the [Magic Tissue Box](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-senser) one after the next. But with assistance, they may be able to remove a single Magic Tissue and bring it to their mouth for exploration.

1. Fill the Magic Tissue Box with tissues (without linking them).
2. Sit on the floor and support your baby in a seated position between your legs.
3. Put the box directly in front of your child with a tissue poking out.
4. Support success by lightly tugging on the tissue to loosen it.
5. Encourage your baby to bring it to their mouth for sensory feedback.

## What parents are asking our experts…

> “How much solid food should my 6 month old be eating each day? She loves puréed food!”

**Answer:**

At 6 months old, your baby’s primary nutrition should still come from breast milk or formula, so be sure to offer these first when your daughter is hungry. Experiences with solid food at this stage serve as sensory exposure and eating practice rather than a source of nutrition. Even if your baby eats the equivalent of a four-ounce jar’s worth of most single-ingredient purees, the resulting calorie intake will be very low. And, when 6-month-olds are encouraged to self-feed—attempt to bring a loaded spoon to their mouth and use their fingers to feed themselves cubes of very soft solids when they’re ready—most will not succeed in eating very much. The amount of solid food that a baby this age typically consumes can range from whatever lands in their mouth (as opposed to their lap, bib, cheeks, chin, and the floor) to several tablespoons twice a day.   
A good rule of thumb is that your baby should be getting 24 to 32 ounces of breast milk or formula a day. If you notice a significant decrease in this intake, you may need to limit the amount of solids you offer her at each sitting for a few more months. But if breast milk and formula are still on track and you’re offering these first, you can let your puree lover self-feed to fullness, boredom, or distraction.   
Lovevery cares about your baby’s well-being during the exciting transition into solid foods. Child safety is of utmost importance. Please consult your child’s pediatrician before introducing your child to solid foods. They will be able to give you individualized recommendations on the best age to begin, taking into account your child and your family’s health history.   
All parents and caretakers should complete a baby CPR and first aid course from a certified instructor. This will help keep your child safe and give you additional peace of mind while exploring solid foods.   
Solid food can present a choking hazard. Please use caution when experimenting with solids. Always ensure your baby is seated upright, in a highchair, and serve appropriate foods based on your baby’s skill level. All food should be thoroughly cooked and never forced into your baby’s mouth.  If choking occurs, please administer first aid based on your training and call 911 (or your local equivalent) immediately.  
Closely monitor your baby’s reactions when experimenting with common allergens. If you notice a significant physical reaction such as hives, swelling of the lips, wheezing, or repeated vomiting, please seek immediate medical attention and consult with your child’s pediatrician before experimenting further.  
Allergic reactions can be genetic in origin. If your child’s birth family has a history of significant allergies, please consult your child’s pediatrician and/or a pediatric allergist before experimenting with foods other than breast milk or formula.
