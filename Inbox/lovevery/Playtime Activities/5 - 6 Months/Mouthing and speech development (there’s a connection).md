Your baby is tasting and mouthing everything they can right now. Until about month 12, babies take in more information through their mouths than they do through their fingers. At this stage, the nerves in your baby’s mouth are more developed than those in any other part of their body.

Studies show that mouthing objects can help your baby’s speech development, but it’s important to know what is safe for them to put in their mouth.

## Here are some objects you may already have in your house for safe (supervised\*) mouthing and exploration:

* Silicone-tipped spatula
* Baby toothbrush
* Partially-frozen washcloth
* Metal spoon
* Wooden spoon
* Hands and feet: your baby may love to suck on their own—or your—fingers or toes 🙂

\*Supervising your baby with these objects is important because they could choke on the handle of a spoon or toothbrush if it goes too far into their mouth. Also, make sure small items that your baby could choke on are out of reach.

### Things your baby might love to mouth but shouldn’t

* Your real keys: Babies love the jangle of keys, but as tempting as they are, they may contain lead and can be dirty. Instead, your baby may enjoy the ring of the **[Rolling Bell](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-charmer)** or the jangle of the **[Wooden Rattle](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-charmer)**.
* Real tissues: babies can gag or choke on soggy, wadded-up tissues. Encourage your baby to play with the **[Magic Tissues](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-senser)**. The bright colors provide visual stimulation and they can be easily washed.
* Wipes: wipes manufacturers do not intend for your baby to mouth and suck on them. If your baby is fascinated by wipes, try offering them the **[Bright & Light Play Scarf](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-explorer)**. It’s perfect for a game of peek-a-boo or simply to explore with their mouth and hands.
