Around 6 months, your baby is continuing to work on strength and building crucial muscles. Tummy time continues to be just as important as it has been in the last several months. Your little one is starting to realize that their body can do so much more.

[Jessica Rolph](https://www.instagram.com/jessicarolph/) (Lovevery Co-Founder and CEO) and Rachel Coley (Licensed Occupational Therapist and Founder of [Cando Kiddo](https://www.candokiddo.com/)) cover the gross motor milestones that parents wonder most about during this stage.

Your baby’s development path is just as unique and personal as your baby. All little ones develop so differently. The last thing we want to do is put pressure on parents or get caught up in milestones and timelines. We discuss these topics so that you can use this information as helpful guidelines to prepare for this stage and what to expect next.

### Sitting

* When to know if your baby is ready to sit
* Ways to help your baby build the strength needed for sitting

### Floor Play for Sitters

* Horizontal milestones to work on before sitting
* Why the floor is still the best place for play

### Keeping Tummy Time Interesting

* Ideas for tummy time at this stage
* Sensory play and activities to keep your baby engaged
* Tummy time progression: head turning, reaching, pivoting, and crawling

### Recommended Time in Seats/Gear

* Recommendation for seats/gear versus floor play
