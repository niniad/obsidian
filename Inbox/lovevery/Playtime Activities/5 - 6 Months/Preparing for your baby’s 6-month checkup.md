This pediatric visit may focus on introducing solid foods. The doctor will also do a full exam, including measuring your baby’s length, weight, and head circumference.

## Leading up to the checkup

**Consider waiting to introduce solids until after the visit**. As your baby approaches 6 months, you may be thinking about giving them solid foods. The pediatrician can evaluate if your baby is ready based on developmental factors like sitting up with support (towels wedged into the highchair are okay) and [good neck and head control](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/head-control-your-babys-first-big-motor-skill/), meaning your baby can hold their head straight up. You can also get advice on [food-related topics for babies](https://lovevery.com/products/the-food-before-1-course-pack): foods to offer first, baby-led weaning vs. purées, how much breastmilk or formula your baby still needs, and how often to feed your baby solids.

**Think about your baby’s social and emotional development**. At this age, your baby likely:

* Recognizes familiar faces
* [Enjoys looking at their reflection](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/who-is-that-cutie-in-the-mirror/)
* [Laughs](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/when-do-babies-start-laughing/)
* [Babbles a bit](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/screeches-and-first-babbles/)

They may even [turn at the sound of their name](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/when-do-babies-know-their-name/) ❤️ Milestones like these can be tough to assess in an office visit, so your doctor may ask you about them.

## At your baby’s 6-month doctor’s visit

**Be open about your sleep strategy**. Your pediatrician is there to help your baby get enough sleep and keep them safe while they do it. The best approach is to be open about where your baby sleeps and share any worries you might have. Your pediatrician may have some ideas about how your baby (and you) can get more sleep.

**Get your pediatrician’s take on [pacifier use](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/pacifier-pros-and-cons/)** The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends giving your baby a pacifier at both naptime and bedtime to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The group also recommends starting to wean from the pacifier to only sleep-time between 6 and 12 months. Ask your pediatrician what they think, and perhaps get some tips about how to limit pacifier use.

**Discuss developmental milestones** You can ask your pediatrician if you have any questions or concerns about your baby’s development. Pediatrician and Lovevery expert Dr. Mona Amin shares this milestones-to-monitor checklist for 6-month-olds. Talk to your pediatrician if your baby doesn’t:

1. Show affection to you
2. [Try to reach for items within reach](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/reach-grasp-mouth-repeat/)
3. Make any laughing or squealing sounds
4. [Sit with help](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/supporting-your-new-little-sitter/)
5. Have head control when sitting
6. [Roll over in either direction](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/everything-you-need-to-know-about-babies-and-rolling/)
7. Hold their head up when pulled to a seated position (called head lag)
8. Bring items to their mouth
9. [Focus their eyes](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/the-big-change-in-your-babys-vision/) (eyes still still seem crossed).

**Talk about teething** Knowing the difference between teething discomfort and illness can be confusing. Your pediatrician may remind you to contact them about signs of illness (not teething) if your baby has a fever above 100.4, diarrhea (that occurs repeatedly, 3 to 4 times a day), and a full body rash.

If your baby is teething and home remedies aren’t working, you can ask about over-the-counter pain medication, which teething gels are considered safe, and if certain homeopathic teething tablets are okay.

**Share how you’re feeling** If you’re crying often, unable to sleep even when your infant is asleep or with another caregiver, eating more or less than normal, or feeling worthless, you may have postpartum depression. Tell your child’s pediatrician. They can point you toward treatment resources, which helps your baby, too.
