After numerous play studies, weeks of in-home testing, and thousands of customer surveys, we are excited to announce updates to our award-winning [Play Gym](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-gym), now designed with even more developmental support for your baby.

So what’s different? Our updated Play Gym includes higher-contrast colors to encourage your baby’s developing vision, new plaything shapes and sizes for better grasping and motor development, and a redesigned hideaway pocket in the Hide & Find Zone to make learning about containment and object permanence more intuitive.

## Here’s an overview of what’s new

#### Learn to Focus Zone

Babies love faces and contrast, so we incorporated images with dark hair, bright hair, and bigger facial expressions.

#### Exploring Colors Zone

This area includes bigger tabs with an updated rainbow to introduce your baby to different colors.

#### How Things Feel Zone

Each textured tab is now enlarged to make them easier for your baby to grasp. This zone is perfect for sensory play during tummy time, which builds strength for reaching, rolling, and crawling.

#### Making Sounds Zone

We gave this zone a fresh look with an updated pattern and new Sound Squares that help your baby explore cause and effect. The new squares are easy to clean and can be removed for on-the-go play.

#### Hiding & Finding Zone

This zone of The Play Gym has been updated to encourage your baby to explore the concepts of containment and object permanence. Our testing showed that using high-contrast colors helped babies locate the pocket, then grasp the ring and move it in and out.

#### Play Space Cover

The Play Space Cover is now double-sided, extending the years of play with your Play Gym. Babies are drawn to the high-contrast pattern, and toddlers love to have their very own “secret” play space.

#### High-Contrast Ball

Now a truer black color, the High-Contrast Ball is detachable and perfectly shaped for grasping, passing from hand to hand, and rolling.
