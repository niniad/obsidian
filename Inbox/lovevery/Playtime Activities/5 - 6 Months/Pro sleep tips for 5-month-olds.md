At 5 months, your baby may be able to go longer between nighttime feedings. At the same time, you may find them starting to [practice new motor skills when they’re supposed to be sleeping](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/why-is-my-baby-crawling-in-their-sleep/) **🙃**

They may get stuck in a position that they don’t know how to get out of. For example, if they roll onto their belly, they may get upset when they can’t figure out how to roll onto their back, even if they can do it when awake.

To help your 5-month-old sleep better and longer, try these tips

## Time it right

Babies sleep best during their natural sleep waves. **By 5 months, your baby’s best naps will likely fall at about 8:30 a.m., 12:30 p.m., and 3:30 p.m.**

The ideal bedtime is usually between 6:30 and 7 p.m. but if your baby didn’t nap well or seems particularly tired, you can certainly put them to bed earlier. Babies who go to bed early don’t necessarily wake up earlier. In fact, if you put your baby down to bed too late, they may wake up even earlier than their usual time.

## Keep the room dark

Blackout shades and curtains are an effective way to ensure sunlight doesn’t disrupt your baby’s sleep. Even without them, you can position your baby’s crib away from any windows and cover them with a dark sheet or towel.

## Reinforce desired habits

If your baby is always rocked to sleep, they’ll expect to be rocked to sleep. If they’re always fed to sleep, they’ll expect to be fed every time they wake up. That’s totally fine if it’s working for both of you.

At 5 months, your baby may be ready to learn to fall asleep on their own. If you’re looking for a new approach, it could be a good time to consider teaching your baby some self-soothing methods and [introducing a brief bedtime routine](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/establishing-a-baby-bedtime-routine/).
