‘Serve and return’ is a phrase coined by Harvard researchers to describe back-and-forth interactions between adults and children. One person “serves” by offering up a sound, smile, word, or gesture, and the other “returns” it:

1. Your baby looks at you and you smile.
2. Your baby waves their arms and you say, “Hi, Baby!”
3. Your baby makes a sound, and you make the same sound back.

## **Why is “serve and return” important?**

Although this may not feel like a typical conversation, interactions like these are a critical part of your baby’s cognitive growth. Multiple research studies support that back-and-forth interactions with your baby are as critical for your baby’s language development as talking to them.

## **How to engage your baby in back-and-forth interactions:**

### **Notice their “serves”**

Your baby is in the very early stages of learning to communicate, so it isn’t always easy to tell when they are seeking an interaction with you. At first, their signs may be subtle, like eye contact, arm waving, or kicking. Even if you’re not sure, you can take the opportunity to connect by talking to them ❤️

### **Narrate** **what’s happening**

Talking to someone who can’t talk back can feel strange at first; try simply describing what your baby sees. Explain what you’re doing, where you’re going, and any sensations your baby is experiencing. For example, you can take them on a house tour and turn the lights off and on for them. Talk to them about it: “Now the lights are on—click!—Now the lights are off.”

### **Give them lots of time to reply**

Consider slowing things down when you engage with your baby. Pause and allow them plenty of time to make a sound or gesture in response.
