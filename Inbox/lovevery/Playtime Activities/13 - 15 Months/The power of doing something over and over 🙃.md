## Simple repetitive play offers rewards

When playing with the[Carrots](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-babbler) and [Carrot Lid for the Coin Bank](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-babbler), your child might push the carrots into the wooden box and enjoy their success for a moment. Then, they may be ready to retrieve the carrots and do it again—over and over.

## A simple way to increase your toddler’s attention span

When you read a book or practice stacking blocks with your toddler, you do more than bond with them. You also help increase their attention span **❤️**

Two related studies published in 2019 and 2022 found that when parents and their toddlers focused on a toy together, the toddlers paid attention a little longer and engaged in more complex play. This is called “joint attention.” In the studies, the toddlers continued to play with their toys—even after the parents shifted their attention away.

### 3 key takeaways to help increase your toddler’s attention span

**Touch, gesture, and talk about their toys.** Play alongside your toddler as they put a ball down the **Slide & Seek Ball Run**. Gesture to show them how to open the different doors and get the ball out, narrating as you play: “Look, here’s the ball!”

**Use action words.** One study showed that when parents used “action-orienting” talk—”Let’s roll the ball!”—the toddlers engaged in even richer and deeper play. Watch your toddler and comment on their actions or what they could do next. You could say, “Do you want to feed your bunny a carrot?” or “Let’s knock over the tower!”

**Follow your toddler’s lead.** Notice where your toddler looks or reaches and then focus on that object together. According to one of the studies, toddlers paid attention longer when their parents followed their child’s interests.

## What parents are asking our experts…

> “My toddler likes to do the same things over and over again. How do I know when to change things up?”

**Answer:**

Doing the same thing again and again may seem boring to you, but it’s essential for your toddler’s learning. Through repetition, your child develops persistence and focus. When he repeatedly sends balls and other objects down The Slide & Seek Ball Run (The Babbler Play Kit) and then peeks into the doors to see what’s inside, he’s practicing fine motor skills and visual spatial awareness as well as investigating object permanence and cause and effect more deeply than he has in the past. These are just a few of the ways in which your son learns by rote. When he loses interest in an activity, that’s the time to move on.
