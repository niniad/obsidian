In 2021, a global study found that 13-month-olds who used touch-screen devices during the day lost, on average, one minute of nighttime sleep for each minute of use.  
  
Television screens have long been known to disrupt sleep. Now, researchers are learning that handheld devices may be an even bigger issue because they’re much closer to children’s faces.

## How screens affect sleep and development

The American Academy of Pediatrics advises no screen time at all, aside from video calls, before 18 months. Other experts recommend waiting to introduce screens for as long as possible. Here’s why:

* The bright blue lights emitted by electronic screens can disrupt a toddler’s circadian rhythms—often referred to as the body’s internal clock—and interfere with the release of melatonin.
* The digital programming made for young children can activate psychological arousal, the state of being alert, active, and awake, making it harder to fall asleep.
* Lack of sleep associated with screen exposure can cause both short- and long-term problems, including negative effects on behavior, memory, cognitive growth, and metabolism.
