**Wooden Stack & Slot**

This isn’t your average ring stacker 😉 The Wooden Stack & Slot helps your toddler learn about spatial relationships and depth perception as they simultaneously practice grasping and releasing.

On one side of the plaything, your 1-year-old can work to slot one ring at a time. The ring won’t drop all the way down unless your child presses it with another ring or pulls it with their finger. When the ring comes out, it will roll in one of two directions. Your child will enjoy trying to predict where it will go and chasing after it—over and over again 🙂

**Posting Lid & Trees**

At this age, your toddler may love pushing objects through holes, an activity known as posting. We recommend introducing the Posting Lid & Trees after your child has fully explored the other two lids for the Wooden Coin Bank that come in The Babbler Play Kit.

Because of how small the holes are, the Posting Lid is the most challenging of the set. As your toddler plays, they’ll discover different ways to hold the small trees—grasping the branches or using two fingers to grip the trunks. All this practice builds their finger dexterity and hand-eye coordination.

These updates were made with you and your child in mind. Our Play Kits can help your child practice, refine, and grow key developmental skills with unique, interactive, and engaging playthings.
