Right now, reading probably doesn’t feel much like “reading.” Your toddler may touch or pat pictures in a book as if they are trying to figure out if the dog they see is alive. They may try to turn two or three pages at a time, turn the pages backward, hold the book upside down, or not even bother to look at the pictures at all.

Your 1-year-old may not be willing to sit with you and a book for even 5 minutes at a time, and likely will not want to read the book from beginning to end. Some toddlers may notice a single favorite object, like the moon, and want to find it in multiple books rather than read through one whole book.

## Here are some suggestions for reading to your toddler:

### Read every day

Try to read for up to five to 10 minutes a day, every day. A few short sessions might work better for your toddler than one longer session.

### Bring books to life

When you and your toddler are spending time with a book, use as many dramatic voices, gestures, and expressions as you can to make the words and/or pictures come alive. You might feel a little bit silly at first, but toddlers love silly 🙃

You can also use [Readmio](https://www.readmio.com/) to add exciting sound effects to Lovevery books like ‘Max and Nana Go to the Park,’ ‘Bea Gets a Checkup,’ and ‘Bedtime for Zoe.’

### [Read books with photos](https://blog.lovevery.com/product-recommendations/introducing-book-bundles-for-the-play-kits-by-lovevery/)

Great books for this age have real-life, clear color photographs, especially of things that are familiar to your toddler.

### Interact

If they name an object in the book, keep the conversation going by expanding that one word into a short descriptive phrase. For example, if they say “baw” to name a picture of a ball, you could say, “Yes, ball! I see there is a ball that is big and yellow in the picture.”

### Connect to the real world

Connect the book to your toddler’s real-world experiences. For example, you could imitate the sound of the dog in the picture and talk about a time when the neighbor’s dog walked by.

### Keep books everywhere

Keep a couple of books in your diaper bag, next to the changing table, and even in the pockets of your car doors.

### Expect wear and tear

Model your enjoyment and proper care of books, but don’t expect your toddler to handle books with care for quite a while. If they seem to be purposefully tearing book pages, they may be more interested in exploring cardboard or paper. Remove the book and offer them something to tear.
