Active play is essential for helping 2-year-olds develop coordination—they’re learning to stop suddenly, keep their balance, and avoid obstacles in their path. But you don’t need a big, open space to help your child develop these important skills. When you can’t get to the playground or [run around the backyard](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/obstacle-course/), try these indoor activities from pediatric physical therapist and Lovevery expert Maral Amani, using beloved playthings from previous **[Play Kits](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits)**.

### 1. Walk along a DIY balance beam

Flip over the **[Circle of Friends Puzzle](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-babbler), [Geo Shapes Puzzle](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-realist), and** [**Friends of All Shapes Puzzle**](https://www.target.com/p/lovevery-friends-of-all-shapes-puzzle/-/A-82224606)**.** Line the bases up end to end on a carpet or rug to create a balance beam. Then, hold your child’s hands and encourage them to put one foot in front of the other.

### 2. Pretend to be a bus driver

Set out pillows on the floor. Then invite your child to push the **[Wheel Around Town Bus](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-realist)** over the pillow piles. Moving the bus up, down, and around helps your toddler learn to balance.

### 3. Carry a cup full of water

Place the **[Super Sustainable Sink](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-helper)** on one side of the room and a large bowl on the other. Encourage your child to fill up a cup at the sink, then slowly walk across the room to pour water into the bowl.

### 4. Rescue the animals

Use painter’s tape to secure the **[Quilted Critters](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-realist)** to a wall, high enough that your child has to get on their tiptoes to reach them. Place the pocketed holder on the floor. Encourage your toddler to grab each critter, then squat down and place them into the holder. When your child gets on their tiptoes, it strengthens the muscles they need for jumping.

### 5. Move and search for a match

Spread out dots from the **[Drop & Match Dot Catcher](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-helper)**. Have your child twirl the **[Spinning Rainbow](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-senser)** and name the color on top. Then ask them to search the room for a matching color dot.

### 6. Sweep up a button mess

Tape a large square on the floor using painter’s tape. Place buttons from the [**Mosaic Button** **Board**](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-companion)on the floor, then show your child how to sweep buttons into the square using a broom. This movement helps your toddler practice coordination and motor planning—a kind of problem solving that involves understanding how to move your body to accomplish a task.

### 7. Step from one lily pad to the next

Tape the **[Magic Tissues](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-senser)** to a carpeted floor. Pretend the floor is a lake and encourage your child to make their way across the “lily pads” without stepping in the water. For a challenge, have your child try to jump from tissue to tissue.

### 8. Walk like an animal

Gather animals from your past Play Kits and place them into a bag. Pull out the animals one at a time and encourage your child to imitate its movement.

### 9. Have a dance party

Turn on your child’s favorite song and encourage them to move to the beat. They can spin and twirl with **[Play Scarf](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-explorer)** or use the **[Simple Concertina](https://lovevery.com/products/the-music-set)** to play along with the music.
