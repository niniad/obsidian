# Welcome to The Enthusiast Play Kit for months 28-30

Source: https://blog.lovevery.com/product-recommendations/welcome-to-the-enthusiast-play-kit-for-months-28-30/

Two is one of our favorite ages, truly. Around the age of two, children begin to find their voice, experiment with more humor, and pursue independence. Every challenge is a chance for discovery, and every emotion is an opportunity to learn something new. So, forget ‘the terrible twos.’

Over the next few months, you may notice your child learning to repeat sounds and words, match shapes and colors, develop their motor skills, navigate independence and identity, and push boundaries.

[The Enthusiast Play Kit](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-enthusiast) will help lead the way through these fun changes. Through purposeful play, each of the six Playthings will help your child understand shapes, learn about balance, explore pretend play, and develop fine motor skills.

Each one-of-a-kind Plaything was designed with love to best support your child’s development. We can’t wait to share them with you.

We also encourage you to explore the Play Guide for expert-backed tips, fun at-home activities, and month-by-month support. Every page helps you make the most of at-home learning and your time together.
