My first company, [Happy Family Organics](https://www.happyfamilyorganics.com/), grew—like Lovevery—out of a desire to give children the best possible start in life. The same research holds true in nutrition as it does in brain science: The first three years of life are critical. The hard part is getting our children to eat the foods we know are good for them 🙃

Happy Family has done a lot of research over the years to understand what nutrients babies and young children need to thrive and help parents give them wholesome, varied diets and strong lifetime habits.

## Here’s what Happy Family has to say about picking eating and toddler nutrition

At age 2, it seems to happen all of a sudden: Your baby is a champ eater then—snap!—picky eating begins. Foods they used to love may now be refused and new foods are a fight. Meal times begin to feel a little more stressful. While this is a normal part of toddlerhood, it certainly can be frustrating. Read on for some tips that may help make meal time more enjoyable.

### What makes our kids picky eaters?

* Toddlers’ growth rate slows down from when they were infants, and often so does their appetite.
* Becoming weary of new foods is believed to be an evolutionary benefit for young children to protect them from eating potentially poisonous plants. In modern days, this can be a barrier to trying new and safe foods.
* Young children need and love snacks and drinks. However, too much of these can crowd out meals, especially if poorly timed.
* Children and people all interpret sensory stimuli differently. Children with strong sensory responses may experience taste and smell more strongly, making them more sensitive to foods and thus “picky eaters.”
