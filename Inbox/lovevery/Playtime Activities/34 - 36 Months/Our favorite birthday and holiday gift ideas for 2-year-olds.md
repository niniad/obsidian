By the time your child is 2 years old, you’ve seen them grow and develop in fascinating ways. Now, they’re refining their gross and fine motor skills, learning new words, and beginning to show signs of independence ❤️

## What is the best gift for a 2-year-old?

We’ve grouped this collection of fun, engaging gift ideas for 2-year-olds by developmental benefit, with a range of ideas in each category from big to small.

## Gifts to encourage gross motor skills

Anyone who loves a 2-year-old is amazed by their boundless energy. Your 2-year-old is learning to coordinate their movements as they climb, run, jump, and balance. These gift ideas support your constantly-moving 2-year-old’s motor skill development.

### Indoor climber and slide

If your toddler wants to climb on all your furniture, an [indoor climber and slide](https://lilyandriver.com/products/little-climber)—also known as a Pikler triangle—makes a smart gift. Used indoors or outdoors, it’s a safe way for young children to practice climbing, sliding, and balancing. The angle of the slide can be adjusted as their skills progress.

### Hoop set
