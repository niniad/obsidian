# Welcome to The Free Spirit Play Kit for months 34-36

Your child is on the brink of what is sometimes referred to as “the magic years”—a time when language blossoms, independence kicks into high gear, and social-emotional skills start to sharpen. Chances are your child is asking *lots* of questions, playing pretend with no shortage of imagination, and always on the move.

[The Free Spirit Play Kit](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-free-spirit) celebrates this stage with Playthings that empower independence, encourage curiosity, and strengthen executive functioning.

The seven Playthings in your next kit are accompanied, as always, by the Play Guide. It contains all the research you don’t have time to do, some helpful tips to keep in mind as you navigate new changes, and more at-home activity ideas.
