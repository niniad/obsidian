# Welcome to The Thinker Play Kit for months 11-12

Source: https://blog.lovevery.com/product-recommendations/welcome-to-the-thinker-play-kit-for-months-11-12/

Even though your baby has been thinking hard since before they were born, big new concepts are starting to materialize at this age. Things exist even when we can’t see them, objects that look alike can behave differently, and some things can change shape; these and other concepts become illuminated at this time. In the next couple months before they turn one, your baby may also start crawling, show that they recognize their name, sit without being propped up, or wave. They may even start to walk!

[The Thinker Play Kit](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-thinker) is designed for what their brain is working on right now, including Opposite Balls that look the same but feel very different (one is light, the other quite heavy!) and a Sliding Top Box that encourages problem solving skills, as well as other child-tested playthings and activities made for right now.

For more ways to play and learn, plus developmental information and tons of new activities, be sure to check out the Play Guide that comes in the kit.
