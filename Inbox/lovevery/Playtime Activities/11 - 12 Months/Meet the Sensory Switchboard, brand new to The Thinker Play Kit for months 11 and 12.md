By 11 to 12 months of age, most babies are fascinated by cause and effect—which is why they love to push buttons and switch lights on and off 🙃 The **Sensory Switchboard**, a brand-new addition to [The Thinker Play Kit](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-thinker), taps into this natural interest, offering a variety of interactive buttons and switches for your child to explore.

**Cause and effect in action**  
The Sensory Switchboard includes three distinct switches that each create a unique real-world effect. When your child pushes the green button, a green disc pops up. And when they flip the blue switch, a blue disc appears. This shows your child that each action has its own distinct outcome—and how they can have an impact on their environment.

**Full-range fine motor play**  
The Sensory Switchboard is designed to help your toddler develop fine motor strength and dexterity for practical skills, like holding a fork, squeezing a spray bottle, and using buttons and zippers. The switches vary in difficulty and give your child practice with a range of hand and finger movements. The first simple button encourages your child to isolate their index finger, an important precursor to [pointing](https://blog.lovevery.com/skills-stages/pointing/). The second switch is a toggle that involves fine motor coordination, while the third and most advanced switch twists, requiring a full-hand motion. Repeating these movements over and over again can lead to more precision over time.

**Sensory integration without sensory overload**  
Unlike a real switchboard, the Sensory Switchboard doesn’t light up or make sounds—but that’s by design. Instead, it provides sensory input without flashing lights and manufactured noises that can be distracting or overwhelming for a child. Playing with the Sensory Switchboard helps your baby link specific finger movements to certain visual cues, strengthening the sensory integration of touch and vision.
