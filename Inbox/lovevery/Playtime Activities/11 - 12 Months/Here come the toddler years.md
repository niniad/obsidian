From birth to age 3, your baby’s brain will triple in size, with most of that growth occurring in the first two years. Your baby had so many firsts in the last 12 months—over the next year, they’ll build on all of that learning with your help.

## Happy birthday, baby!

Happy birthday, baby! And happy anniversary to YOU!

Let’s say it together: this birthday is A. Big. Deal. While it is so fun to celebrate them, I want to take a moment to celebrate you.

I want you to know all of the reasons why you are already a great parent:

Your child’s progress will ebb and flow, but your devotion is constant. You cheer them on and believe in what’s possible for them. You see that they can do something today that they couldn’t do yesterday and you know that’s enough.

Your everyday love and affection give them courage. By just being who you are in their life, they learn that it is safe to take a risk and that there are people in this world they can count on no matter what. They already sense your belief in them, and it helps them believe, too.

As the mother of three children a little older than yours, let me offer you some assurances:

1. You **will** have uninterrupted sleep again—maybe not next week or next month, but it will happen.
2. Life will never go back to “normal,” but you will find your new normal. If you haven’t found it yet, it will come. You will be able to carve out time to just be you.
3. Parenthood in all its forms is valuable work. And whether you earn a paycheck right now or not, no choice has to be permanent.

If you are at home with your baby, know that you will have options and are not going to lose your edge. You continue to grow and gain expertise and insight all the time.

If you have a job, know that you are creating meaningful memories with your baby in your time together. They recognize when you are present with them and feel your special bond.

Take a moment to enjoy this milestone for your baby and for you. Thank you for letting us be a part of your life.

## Encourage your baby’s budding sense of humor

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.lovevery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Instagram-Facts-and-Tips_App_Month-12_3.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&ssl=1)

While your baby may have been laughing for a few months, now they are entering a new phase. Starting between 12 and 18 months, your toddler may start noticing what is normal and what is unexpected or out of the ordinary. As long as what’s happening doesn’t scare them, they may find it silly and laugh.

**Ideas to encourage your baby’s humor**

Your baby may find humor in contradictions, so you can encourage their laughter by doing something silly like pretending to drink from their bottle or cup, or putting one of their shoes on their head.

Try to repeat the things that make your baby laugh as they stay amused—babies love repetition at this age. It will encourage their budding sense of humor.

## Pushing a button can strengthen fingers

The green button on the [Sensory Switchboard](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-thinker) requires your baby to isolate one finger and push down.

Repeating this simple movement helps them gain strength in their index finger and hands that will help them refine their pincer grasp.

## Setting the stage for pretend play

At 12 months old, your little one isn’t yet ready to feed or rock their [Organic Cotton Baby Doll](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-thinker). Pretend play with a doll or stuffy typically doesn’t emerge until anywhere between 14 and 24 months.

Here are some ways to play in the meantime to prepare your child for valuable pretend play down the road:

1. Place the doll in an area where it’s visible so that it becomes familiar to them.
2. Model hugging the doll, then see if your toddler does the same—imitation may develop between 12 and 14 months.
3. Give a simple direction, like “Pick up the baby,” and see if your little one follows. This skill also comes into play between 12 and 14 months.
4. Point to and name body parts on the doll, then name the same parts on your child. Incorporate songs like “Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes.”

When your toddler’s ready for pretend play, their doll can become a valuable tool for developing social-emotional skills, such as empathy, care, and concern for others ❤️
