If your baby has started crawling, or you’ve noticed them holding their weight up on one arm while reaching and grabbing with the other, you can try this simple activity with them.

Every step works new skills for your baby. They practice problem solving as they observe the animals in the basket and make a plan to get them. Then, when they reach into the basket, they work their arm and core muscles. Once they grasp for a toy, they build fine motor control. The feeling of sweet victory they get from rescuing their toy from the laundry basket motivates them to keep trying 🙂
