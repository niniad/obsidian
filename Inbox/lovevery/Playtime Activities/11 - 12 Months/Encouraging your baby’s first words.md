You may soon notice subtle shifts in your baby’s babbles—changes in tone and rhythm that indicate their first words are on the way. Continue talking, listening, and reading to your baby to encourage their vocalizations.

## When will your baby say their first word?

Most children say their first word between 12 and 14 months of age, and have between 1 and 3 words by around 15 months. According to speech and language experts The Speech Sisters, only about 25% of children have 14 or more words at 12 months.

Remember, babies begin understanding, babbling, and using gestures before they’re able to say recognizable words. Around 11 to 13 months, your baby will likely understand between 20 and 100 words.  For example, when you call them by name, they may look at you, or when you say, “Want me to pick you up?” they may reach for you.

You’ll know your baby is getting ready to talk when their babble takes on more intonation and rhythm, and they’re using longer strings of varied syllables. You might hear a rise at the end of a string of babble, indicating a question. Or, your baby may babble and then look at you expectantly, as they wait for you to respond to what they’ve said ❤️

### What counts as a first word?

Officially, your baby’s word is recognizable, used in context, spoken independently, and used more than once. Speech and language experts break this down further by explaining that word approximations like “ba” for “bottle,” animal sounds, and words like “uh-oh” count, too.

### How can you help your baby begin talking?

1. Talk to them often and slowly, using a higher-pitched voice.
2. Tune into their vocalizations and attempts to communicate by responding as if you understand.
3. Repeat key words like “up,” names of family members, “uh-oh,” and favorite foods.
4. Read your baby’s cues and teach them the word they want to say. For example, if they say “ba, ba, ba” while looking around, and you think they might be looking for their bottle, ask them and repeat the word. Say, “Do you want your bottle? I see your bottle right here. Here’s your bottle. Bottle.”

### What if your baby hasn’t started talking yet?

Just because they don’t have a spoken word at 12 months, that doesn’t necessarily mean they aren’t on track. If your baby’s babble and chatter are progressing and they’re engaged with you, they may just need a little more time. Talk to your pediatrician about any concerns you may have.

## Expert tips for teaching your baby to talk

You can make an important difference in your baby’s early attempts to talk by doing these 5 simple things.

### 1. Slow down and ‘OWL’

Babies process language much more slowly than adults, and need extra time to think, react, and respond. Speech and language experts recommend “Owling”—Observing, Waiting, Listening—when your baby is trying to talk. It might look like this:

1. Your baby says a partial word like “da.” **Observe** their gestures and expressions, look at their surroundings, and consider what you think they’re talking about.
2. Even if you know they mean “dog” or “doggy,” try to **wait**. Experts recommend waiting 10 seconds, which can feel like a long time, but your baby’s brain is working hard to form that word. If you wait, they may try it again. In this case, ‘waiting’ means: stop talking, lean forward, and look at your baby expectantly.
3. Next, **listen** to whatever sound they make. Even if you know what they’re saying, try not to interrupt or fill in silences. You can “shape” their word by saying the full word for them, then waiting again. If your baby says ‘ca’ you can say ‘car’ for them. Try to limit your language when your baby is actively trying to speak.

### 2. Expand a known word’s meaning

When you’re confident your baby knows a word and is using it regularly, you can help them start to understand it in context by “expanding” it. For example, when they say “ca” or “car,” you can expand the word’s meaning by using it in a phrase like, “Fast car, vroom! Look at the fast car go! Fast car!”

### 3. Get the most out of reading

[Reading to your baby](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/it-can-last-less-than-a-minute-but-makes-a-big-difference/) supports their language development, but it may only last a few minutes at this age. That’s okay—they still get a lot out of it. Don’t feel like you need to finish a book or even read every word; instead, follow your baby’s lead and interest. This may mean spending time describing and observing a particular picture they’re interested in rather than finishing the book. Label the picture with a word or two, then wait, giving your baby a chance to repeat the word.

### 4. Talk about everyday things

Studies show that the number of words a baby understands relates to how often they’ve heard high-frequency words that describe everyday things—objects, people, places, and actions. As much as you can, get down to eye level and show interest in what your baby is doing, looking at, and playing with—and label it. (You can [engage them in what you’re doing](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/how-doing-mundane-tasks-like-laundry-can-be-full-of-meaning-for-your-child/), too.) Use these key words often, and don’t limit them just to nouns, verbs, and adjectives; use prepositions (in, out), interjections (uh-oh, whee!), and adverbs (up, down) too.

### 5. Let your baby fill in the gaps

Soon, your baby may be able to fill in gaps when you leave off the last word of a well-known book page or song lyric. Even if they aren’t talking yet you can start now with a song your baby knows. For example, sing “Twinkle twinkle little…” then pause, and observe what your baby does. Even if they make a sound that doesn’t sound like “star,” they’re still beginning to understand that a missing word belongs there.

## Encouraging first words

Your baby may be starting to babble longer strings of consonant-vowel sounds. You may notice them trying to imitate your words and sounds. At this age, repeating the same babble or sound in reference to a particular person or object counts as a word ❤️

Try encouraging your little one’s attempts to speak with the [“Things I See” Texture Cards](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-inspector).

* Point to and name the realistic images on the cards to increase your child’s exposure to common words.
* Enunciate the words clearly again and again.
* Pause and see if they imitate a sound or word approximation back.
* If they do make a sound, make the same sound back to them.
