We all love music—its incredible range of benefits has been well-documented, especially for babies and young children (and their parents!). From developing neural pathways to bonding, from encouraging language development to the calming effect of endorphin release, music is almost magical in its impact.

There are times when it’s hard to pick just the right tune for just the right time. We’ve got you covered: [Lovevery’s Spotify page](https://open.spotify.com/user/awkbsgni64mc6fhdokp8kcg0b?si=AD7yu5SSRQam0_VNQdklJg) includes playlists for different moods and routines: soothing [lullabies for bedtime](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ZyRChGrJDoumNLMlTrveh?si=NP5M6VFcSZm41UD6EZ7suQ), uptempo tunes for [dance parties](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2qpTLPTaxPqk5knHFRAdh1?si=fk0XbbSIQq2S2fE0WIHS-Q), and more.
