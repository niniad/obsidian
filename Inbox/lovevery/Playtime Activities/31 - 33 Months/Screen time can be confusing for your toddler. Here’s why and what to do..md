Screen time is a reality for many families at this age. While there’s no harm in putting your 2-year-old in front of the TV for an episode of an age~~–~~appropriate show, research shows they still can’t understand much of what they see. To get something out of it—like new words or social-emotional messages—they need your help. Here are our experts’ top tips:

### Help them understand the storyline

**Summarize the story.** To help them process the concepts in a show, you can summarize plot points. For example, “Daniel Tiger really wanted to play with blocks, but now he can’t. He looks frustrated.”

**Explain symbolism in animation.** Your toddler is also starting to learn that the images on screen represent things in real life. Help them make connections: “Bluey has a cup of water and you have a cup of water. Cup and cup!”

### Relate what they see to off-screen experiences

**Connect the show to your child’s day.** For example, “I saw that Daniel was eating breakfast. What did you have for breakfast today?” You can save these questions for after the show or during a pause so that your toddler isn’t distracted.

**Talk about how characters are feeling.** For example: “Big Bird was sad when he couldn’t find his ball. Can you make a sad face? What’s something that made you feel sad?” This can build your toddler’s emotional knowledge, while also helping them better understand the story.

### Predict what will happen next

**Discuss the sequence of events.** Emphasize temporal words to help your child develop the concepts of time and sequencing: “**First**, Daniel went to school. **Next**, he played with Prince Wednesday. **Last**, Dad Tiger took him home.”

**Predict what will happen next.** Pause the show and ask, “What do you think will happen when Bluey goes outside?” Making predictions is an essential part of scientific and critical thinking.

### Act out what happened on the screen

**Mimic what the characters do.** Imitating a character’s movements can help your child understand action words. For example, you can dance with Daniel or jump with Bluey as you say, “Spin, spin, spin!” or “We’re jumping!”

**Get moving after viewing.** Get moving once show time is over to help your child regulate their body after all of that sitting and watching. Try extending the learning from the show—“Dora found a purple flower on her hike—let’s see if we can find one on our walk to the playground!”
