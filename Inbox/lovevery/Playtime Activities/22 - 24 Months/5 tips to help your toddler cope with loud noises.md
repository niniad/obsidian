Has your toddler ever burst into tears at the sound of the vacuum cleaner, a bathroom hand dryer, or a clap of thunder? Sudden, loud noises can be startling or even scary to young children. Here are some ways you can help your toddler in the moment:

## Give them a little warning

Whenever you can, let your toddler know when they’re about to hear a loud noise. Explain that you’re going to turn on the kitchen blender, start the hand dryer in a public bathroom, or flush an airplane toilet. Help your child cover their ears and tell them how long the noise is likely to last: “The blender is going to be loud for 10 seconds. Let’s count to 10 together.”

## Get them involved

Giving your toddler some power over loud noises may reduce their sensitivity. You can let your child start and stop the noise by pushing a button, flipping a switch, or just saying “go” and “stop” to direct you.

## Show them loud noises can be fun

Help your toddler associate noisy sounds with something they enjoy doing. For example, you can use the blender to make a smoothie together or blow a cotton ball across the bathroom floor with a hair dryer. Note: Always closely supervise your toddler when using electric appliances, especially near water.

## Help them learn to anticipate sounds

Some loud sounds are predictable, even if they’re out of your control. You can teach your toddler that a flash of light during a fireworks display or thunderstorm typically comes before a big sound. They can cover their ears in anticipation.

## Express both understanding and confidence

Acknowledge your toddler’s feelings and comfort them if they’re upset by a loud sound, but don’t dwell on it. Instead, help them move past it. You could say,  “That sound surprised you! It surprised me, too. Let’s have a hug, then we can keep playing.” If your toddler’s distress over loud noises impacts everyday life, check with their pediatrician for advice on how to manage their sensitivity to sound.
