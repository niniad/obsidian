If your toddler can’t get enough of things that spin, they’re probably working on their “rotation” schema. This is a form of play that can involve rolling balls, pushing toy cars, twirling their body, watching a pinwheel, and turning and twisting anything they can get their hands on.

What they learn from this [schema play](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/what-are-play-schemas-and-how-do-they-help-your-toddler-learn/) will help them later as they tackle math concepts like symmetry and geometry. It can also help develop physical skills like drawing, turning knobs, and dancing.

## 4 ways to support your toddler’s developing rotation schema

**Watch things that spin.** Put things in motion that your toddler can watch go round and round—for example, a pinwheel, a spinning top, a hula hoop, bike tires, or a fidget spinner.

**Roll objects to them.** Sit on the floor a few feet away from them and roll them a ball, toy car, or even a soup can or water bottle on its side.

**Encourage rolling and spinning their body.** Try taking them on a carousel or merry-go-round at the park, letting them roll down a gently sloped hill, or holding them in your arms and twirling them around. Toddlers love getting dizzy, as it informs their [vestibular system](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/why-does-my-child-love-feeling-dizzy/)—a sense that helps them orient their body in space.

**Mix things in a bowl.** Let them stir some water or dry ingredients in a mixing bowl with a spoon or whisk. For more ideas on including your toddler in the kitchen, read
