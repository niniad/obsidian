As someone who has done a ton of travel with three kids, I know how challenging it can be to keep babies and toddlers entertained on a plane. But in committing to going as tech-free as possible, our family finds that air travel is a chance for intimate family connection—something that is way too rare in our busy lives.

Here are some screen-free activities for the plane to try with young children—they’ve worked for our family, and I hope they make the next trip with your baby or toddler not just manageable, but fun.

## Dot sticker play

![Mother and daughter with dot stickers on their face](https://i0.wp.com/blog.lovevery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Weekly_Week-77-Body-1.jpg?resize=1176%2C1176&ssl=1)

Dot stickers are simple and fun and great for developing fine motor skills. They’re also inexpensive and easy for your toddler to peel off of a sheet or roll. Bring a few sheets of [dot stickers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RYZNNV3/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=lovevery-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07RYZNNV3&linkId=d0f29d2c176a6e0d9102d8dd52c35a46), some plain [white paper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AW5V7PE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=lovevery-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01AW5V7PE&linkId=cec4c23195f8648674fb092ddba3c0bd), and a sheet of [construction paper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013CA0LI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=lovevery-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0013CA0LI&linkId=18caccca0cacacac5b0b8bba10ecb590) for these play ideas:

**Name the dots:** Stick the dots on different parts of your toddler’s body and your own. Play “where is your nose, elbow, arm?”

**Dot hide-and-seek:** Stick a dot on yourself without your toddler seeing (on an elbow or knee, for example) and encourage them to find it.

**Dot sticker collage:** Stick dots on a big piece of white paper on the tray table. Have your toddler tear up a piece of construction paper and use the stickers to stick the pieces of torn paper to the white sheet

*Safety note: As always with small objects, supervise your toddler to make sure they don’t put the stickers in their mouth.*

## Win-win wipes

![Toddler wiping down an air plane seat with wet wipes](https://i0.wp.com/blog.lovevery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Weekly_Week-77-Body-2.jpg?resize=1176%2C1176&ssl=1)

We know your toddler loves to pull wipes out of a container. Bring a small [travel pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NVLOXAS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=lovevery-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00NVLOXAS&linkId=a0a943bdbc050629f745db37c7a432c5) just for them and get them to put the wipes to additional use by wiping seats, airplane walls, and tray tables.

## Little presents

![Child sitting in an air plane seat opening a toy](https://i0.wp.com/blog.lovevery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Weekly_Week-77-Body-3.jpg?resize=1176%2C882&ssl=1)

Wrap up some new little toys for your toddler to open that you won’t be devastated to lose. You can wrap them in leftover wrapping paper or newspaper, or in little containers, bags, or small boxes. This is a great way to use up those extra scraps of odd-sized wrapping paper you have lying around if you are anything like me. Unwrapping loosely-wrapped gifts is a great fine motor activity for your toddler, allowing them to practice using both hands at once.

Ideas for inexpensive presents to entertain your baby or toddler on the plane:

**Wind-up toys:** Toddlers love to hold wind-up toys and stop the motion with their hands (they rarely want to just watch it go, and that’s okay).

**Finger puppets:** You can sing songs and play games like peek-a-boo with the puppets on your flight.

**Feathers:** Tickle each other with them, or stick them to paper with the dot stickers.

## Sticky note flags

![Child sitting in an air plane seat playing with post it notes](https://i0.wp.com/blog.lovevery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Weekly_Week-77-Body-4.jpg?resize=1176%2C941&ssl=1)

These are fun to stick around the seats and easy to unstick (and eventually reuse) when you are done.

## Markers and paper

![Child and mother sitting together on an air plane drawing on paper](https://i0.wp.com/blog.lovevery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Weekly_Week-77-Body-5.jpg?resize=1176%2C1176&ssl=1)

If you can stand the mess with washable markers, they make a mark more easily and can be more fun to draw with than crayons. If markers get on the tray table or your toddler’s hands, they can use their own travel pack of wipes to clean it off. For toddlers 2 and up, the [Anywhere Art Kit](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-helper) (from The Helper Play Kit) is a travel-friendly portable case with bright, chunky tempera sticks for no-mess creativity.

I like to bring some blank sheets of white printer paper to color together. Coloring with your toddler makes it more meaningful and they are more likely to stay engaged longer. Child development specialists call this “shared attention.”

You can also use one of the dot stickers to stick and display your toddler’s art on the airplane window or the seat in front of you.

## Books

![Three children and their mother sitting together on an airplane all reading books](https://i0.wp.com/blog.lovevery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Weekly_Week-77-Body-6.jpg?resize=1176%2C1176&ssl=1)

Bring a couple of new, lightweight story books for the plane, as well as a couple of favorites to re-read. Introducing fresh books your toddler isn’t familiar with might get them more excited to be read to. And having at least one reliable favorite on hand is a good idea in case they’re not in the mood for something new.

[The Soft Book](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-charmer) (from The Charmer Play Kit) and [The Silicone Sensory Book](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-senser) (from The Senser Play Kit Book Bundle) are both especially great for traveling with babies, because they’re so light and durable. For toddlers, the interactive cloth book [Plant a Seed and Watch It Grow](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-explorer) (from The Explorer Play Kit Book Bundle) is a story and a plaything all in one.

## Portable, multi-purpose playthings

Our family’s favorite Lovevery playthings for travel with toddlers can be easily stashed in a carry-on, and do double (or triple) duty as a game, a puzzle, and inspiration for imaginative play.

The [Montessori Animal Match](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-companion) (from The Companion Play Kit) comes with a packable drawstring bag for travel‚ and can be played with so many ways on the plane. Match the animals to the tiles, make animal sounds together, play hide-and-seek with the animals, or let your toddler simply pull each animal and tile out of the pouch one by one—and stuff them back in.

One of our favorite on-the-go playthings is the [Fuzzy Bug Shrub](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-adventurer) (from The Adventurer Play Kit). Your toddler can practice that peel-and-stick play that’s so irresistible to them, and they can open the container to stuff the fuzzy bugs in and pull them out, which they’ll want to do over and over again.

## Snacks — but more importantly, the snacks container

Snacks in packaging with open-and-close lids (like puffs) are the best kind. You can play so many games with puff containers or small raisin boxes. Some ideas:

**Puff peek-a-boo:** Hide some puffs in one of your hands and see if your toddler can guess which hand has the puffs.

**Counting games:** Line the puffs up and count them for your toddler on the tray table.

**Here comes the airplane:** If you’re up for it, your toddler will love feeding you. 🙃

## Light switch and air blower exploration

![Child turning on the light on an airplane](https://i0.wp.com/blog.lovevery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Weekly_Week-77-Body-7.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&ssl=1)

Have your toddler stand on your lap or lift them up to reach the light switch (not the flight attendant call button 😉) and narrate “light on, light off.” My little guy said the word “light” for the first time while playing with the switches on an airplane and I will never forget it!

You can also twist the blower on and off and talk about how the air is blowing on their face or through their hair.

## Lap songs and games

Sing songs to your toddler while they sit on your lap or lie down across you. Clap, snap, and make the rhythms come alive—fellow passengers may just join in 🎶. [Here are lyrics to songs](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/lyrics-and-gestures-for-the-best-baby-play-songs-are-here/) that are great for singing and clapping along.

## Ice and plastic cups

Ask for an extra cup and pour ice from one cup to the other or slide the ice around the tray table. Talk about how the ice is cold and then, when it melts, talk about how it is turning to water. Your toddler can use the napkin to wipe up the water.

## Opening and closing the window shades

If you have a window seat, helping your toddler practice opening and closing the window shade with your hand over theirs while saying “open, close” is entertaining.

## An excursion to see the flight attendants

![Child talking to the flight attendant in an air plane](https://i0.wp.com/blog.lovevery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Weekly_Week-77-Body-9.jpg?resize=1176%2C1176&ssl=1)

Sometimes flight attendants are busy and can’t take the time to engage with your toddler. But often they have a few minutes and will welcome the opportunity for a short visit.

* You can have your toddler bring their trash to the back of the plane and throw it away in the flight attendant’s trash bag.
* Your toddler can hand the attendant some of their scribble art or some dot stickers as a “gift.”
* You can go to the back of the plane with your toddler and ask for a cup of ice together.

## Play peek-a-boo

You can play peek-a-boo and if the person behind you is up for it, peeking through the cracks and over the seat is double the fun. The [Bright & Light Play Scarf](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-explorer) (from The Explorer Play Kit) is a great travel plaything for peek-a-boo.

## Opening, folding, and closing the safety pamphlet

In the seat pocket, the safety pamphlet is interesting for your toddler to unfold and refold.

A lot of the ideas for keeping a toddler busy at a restaurant work great for the plane too. DM me with your favorite tips for traveling with your toddler. I’m always on the lookout for more!
