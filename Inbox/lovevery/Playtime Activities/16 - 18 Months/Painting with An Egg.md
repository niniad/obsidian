This is a different way to paint with your little one!

**What you need:**

* A cardboard box or tray
* Paint
* Paper
* Tape
* An egg (you can also use balls or even pinecones or rocks)

**Instructions:**

Tape a piece of paper down to a box or tray. Place dollops of paint on the paper. Drop the egg in and roll it around in the box together. It is really fun to see what kind of designs are created!
