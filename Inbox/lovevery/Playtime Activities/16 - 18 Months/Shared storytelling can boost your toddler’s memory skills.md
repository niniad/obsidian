Research shows that children as young as 13 months are already creating memories, even if they won’t remember them years from now. For example, your toddler is able to recall what happened to them earlier in the day or week—and those memories play an important role in early learning.

## Tell your toddler the story of their day

To encourage your child’s budding memory skills, you can talk about your shared experiences during calm moments, like mealtimes, bath time, or before bed. Include the [who, what, where, and why when you tell them stories](https://lovevery.com/community/blog/child-development/the-toddler-game-of-who-what-where-why-how/) about their day.

For example, when your toddler is taking a bath, you can say: “Remember this morning, when I had to take the garbage bags out to the curb and you watched me from the window? It was raining and my hair got so wet! And you touched my hair and felt that it was all wet, just like yours is now!” By adding details, you help them link what happened earlier to the current moment.

This type of storytelling builds your toddler’s memory, vocabulary, and understanding. As your toddler starts [saying more words](https://lovevery.com/community/blog/child-development/when-will-my-baby-say-their-first-word/), they can add to the stories, too. For now, try to pause throughout the story to let your toddler contribute, even with just a glance, smile, or head shake.
