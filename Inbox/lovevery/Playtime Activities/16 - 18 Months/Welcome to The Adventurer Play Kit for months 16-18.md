# Welcome to The Adventurer Play Kit for months 16-18

Source: https://blog.lovevery.com/product-recommendations/welcome-to-the-adventurer-play-kit-for-months-16-18/

Adventurers are curious—eager to make discoveries and know more about the world around them—just like your growing toddler. Your child may soon understand two new words each day, point to things that intrigue them, want to use their hands more skillfully, and even create their first pieces of artwork.

[The Adventurer Play Kit](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-adventurer) is designed with months 16, 17, and 18 in mind. As your child sends cars zooming down the Race & Chase Ramp, they deepen their understanding of cause and effect. Working with the Wooden Stacking Peg Board, they can practice using their hands more skillfully, explore color matching, and even be introduced to numeracy. With The Adventurer, your toddler will release and race, stack and knock down, open and close, twist and pull—refining motor skills, spatial awareness, and so much more.

Find developmental information, ideas for further exploration with the playthings, and DIY activities to try together in our expert-informed Play Guide that comes in the Kit.
