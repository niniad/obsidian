It’s easy to get caught up in counting your toddler’s words or comparing their vocabulary to another child’s. Conflicting information about what children “should” be able to say at this age can add to the confusion. In reality, the exact number of words your toddler can say right now may not be as important as it seems ❤️

## What’s the right number of words?

Different web sites and experts cite different numbers—one may say 10 words and another may say 50. But there really is no one “right” number. The average vocabulary at 18 months is about 50 words, but toddlers can say far more or fewer and still be on track.

In 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics intentionally removed word counts from their language and communication milestones for this age group. The new milestones, backed by scientific evidence, focus on how children use and understand language. Here’s what they say:

### At 18 months, most children will:

1. Say three or more words or word approximations, aside from “mama” or “dada.”
2. Follow one-step directions—like getting their shoes when you say, “Bring me your shoes”—without seeing you point or gesture to show what you mean.

### At 24 months, most children will:

1. Point to an object in a book when prompted—“Where is the fish?”
2. [Say at least two words together](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/combining-words-a-big-step-in-language-learning/), like “More snack.”
3. Point to at least two body parts when asked.
4. Use gestures aside from waving and pointing, like blowing a kiss or nodding yes.

## Is your toddler’s language development on track?

Expressive language develops at very different rates for different children. Once a toddler’s spoken vocabulary grows to 50 words, it tends to take off in volume and complexity. This [“language explosion”](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/the-science-behind-your-childs-language-explosion/) typically occurs between 15 and 24 months.

As long as your toddler’s expressive language is growing—slowly or quickly—and they seem to understand your simple phrases and requests, they’re likely headed in the right direction. Talking, listening, and responding are the best ways to support your child’s communication skills. Subtle changes in everyday interactions—like when you speak to them—can make a big difference.

## What to do if you have concerns

If your toddler isn’t meeting the CDC language and communication milestones for their age or has lost language skills that they once had, talk to their pediatrician about developmental screening options and other resources. A little extra support at the right time can go a long way.
