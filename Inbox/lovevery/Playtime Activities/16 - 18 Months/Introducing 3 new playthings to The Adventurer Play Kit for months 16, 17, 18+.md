## Pull Puzzle

Part puzzle and part pull toy, this new plaything combines a cognitive challenge with gross motor play.

First, your child can work to solve the puzzle by arranging the three colorful cylinders together in the base. Then, when they pull the puzzle behind them, the cylinders spin and make a fun color pattern. As your child speeds up, the cylinders spin faster and the top barrel spins in a different direction than the bottom two. To keep the barrels nestled inside, your child will need to carefully navigate corners, furniture, and other obstacles. This is both a puzzle and a next-level pull toy.

## Copy Me Cups

Your toddler may recognize the names of a few common body parts by now and be ready to start following one-step directions, like “touch your nose.” The ability to follow two-step directions emerges, on average, around 20 months. The Copy Me Cups can support these important cognitive and language skills—as well as others to come.

Each Copy Me Cup features a photo and instruction. You can pull a cup from the top of the stack and model what you see pictured. Your child can try to imitate you or model what they see in a photo on their own. You can also add in verbal instructions by reading each cup.

Your child may also enjoy playing independently with the cups—stacking them together to make a satisfying “click” into place.

## Update! New Beads in the Threadable Bead Kit
