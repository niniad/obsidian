Now that your child is a toddler, you might see them start to experiment with early pretend play. They may hold up a block to their ear and pretend it’s a phone, or hug their doll, then immediately fling it aside 🙃

Early pretend play is simple, brief, and involves only one step. It is based on imitation, not fantasy; your child will only do something they have seen you do or experienced themselves.

## 3 ways to support your toddler’s early pretend play

**Model simple play scenarios.** The more you show your toddler what simple pretend play looks like, the more they’ll test it out on their own. Try putting a small blanket over their baby doll, giving it a kiss, and saying, “Goodnight, Baby,” or pretend to feed the baby doll and see if your toddler mimics you. While you are working in the kitchen, give your child a little wooden spoon and pot to stir.

**Provide them with props.** Offer your toddler objects that support their new interest in early pretend play including an old cordless phone, empty cup, bowl, plate, and spoon. If your child has a favorite doll or stuffy, you can give them a small stroller, brush, comb, and blanket to help them nurture their little friend.

**Observe and narrate.** Validate and encourage your toddler when they experiment with early pretend play. If they hug their doll, you can say “You’re giving your baby such a nice hug!” If you notice them stirring their spoon in a bowl, try saying, “Look, you’re stirring your pot!”

Making specific observations lets your toddler know that you believe what they’re doing is important.
