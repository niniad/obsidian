Around this age, you may start to notice your baby extending their legs and pushing them against whatever is next to them—toys, furniture, the dog 😊—to work their leg muscles.

Try placing your hand and forearm against the bottoms of your baby’s feet and see if they push their legs against you.

Sometime around 1 ½ to 2 ½ months, your baby will likely start to kick their legs (while on their back) when they get excited. You can help your baby get used to the feeling of kicking by moving their legs alternately while they’re on their back, gently and slowly bending their legs at the hip and knee.

If your baby is already kicking, [here](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/kicking-play-helps-your-baby-learn-to-roll/) are some fun kicking play ideas.
