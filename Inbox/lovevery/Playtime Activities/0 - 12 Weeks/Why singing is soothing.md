Even if you don’t believe you have a good voice, singing to your baby can offer calming benefits ❤️

Even if you don’t like your own voice, singing to your baby can offer calming benefits ❤️

In a 2015 study, researchers from the University of Montreal discovered that babies remained calm twice as long when listening to a song as they did when listening to speech. Lullabies and other soothing songs may help your baby form neural pathways for calming down and falling asleep.

## 5 tips for singing to newborns

1. **Hold your baby against your chest** so they can feel the vibrations you create as you sing. Your voice alone is familiar and soothing, and this adds another layer of comfort.
2. **[Sing a few songs over and over again](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/lyrics-to-the-best-lullabies-are-here/).** You don’t need to know a lot of melodies to soothe your baby.
3. **Make up new words to favorite melodies.** Try using the activity you’re engaged in for inspiration: if your baby is getting fussy as you change their diaper, try something like, “Diaper changing, diaper changing/nice and clean, nice and clean” to the tune of “Are You Sleeping?”
4. **Make it a daily ritual.** Include singing in your baby’s routine, especially in the moments when you want your baby to wind down. Soon they’ll recognize this as a cue to calm down, which makes it easier to transition into sleep.
5. **Use singing to comfort.** Singing can be particularly effective during car rides, doctor’s appointments, or when your baby doesn’t feel well ❤️
