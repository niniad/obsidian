Your baby is waking up to the world more and more with every week that goes by. There are so many things their brain is working on, it can be helpful to have a list.

## Here are the nuanced progressions that child development experts say your baby will likely go through around this time:

### They’ll want to inspect their own hands

Your baby may start getting fascinated with their hands at around 2 to 3 months. They will inspect them and watch what they do when they move. You can help your baby notice their own hands by putting [Black and White Mittens](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker) on them.

### They’ll respond to your voice

Between birth and 2 ½ months, your baby will likely start to show some kind of response to your voice. You can help by talking to your baby as you go about your day together, encouraging them to look at you as you make different sounds with your mouth. Offering your baby lots of language and eye contact will help them tune in and listen to you. Having lots of face-to-face “conversations” with your baby is one of the best things you can do for their development.

### They can track moving objects with their eyes

Your baby will likely track a moving object that slowly moves from one side to the other sometime between 2 and 3 months. You can help them learn by shaking the Silicone Rattle slowly from one side to the other about 8 inches away from their face.

### They’ll look for the source of a sound

Between about 2 and 3 ½ months, your baby may start looking for the source of sounds they hear. You will see them tuning in and looking, but they will likely not find the source of the sound or even necessarily look in the right direction. You can help them by clinking spoons, tearing paper, or shaking the [Silicone Rattle](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker). See if they look around, and if they don’t respond, keep making the sound and slowly move the source until they can see it.

### They’ll do a “half-roll”

Between 1 ½ and 2 months, your baby may start to do a half-roll when placed on their side, moving from their side to their back. You can help by putting your baby in a side-lying position and giving them the black and white images to look at in the [Card Holder](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker). After a few minutes of side-lying, take the Card Holder out of their view and shake the Silicone Rattle over their head to see if they roll onto their back.

### They’ll kick when excited

Between 1 ½ and 2 ½ months, your baby may kick their legs up and down when they get excited 🙂 You can encourage your baby to start kicking by placing them so their legs will hit the [Batting Ring](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-gym#batting-ring) in [The Play Gym](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-gym).
