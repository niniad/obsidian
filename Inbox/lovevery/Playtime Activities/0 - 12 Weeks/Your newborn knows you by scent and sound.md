During the early weeks of life, babies use their sense of hearing and smell to identify the people closest to them. Because [your baby’s eyesight is still developing](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/why-black-and-white-is-so-riveting-to-your-newborn/), it may take a little longer for them to recognize your face.

## How and when recognition starts

**Knowing you by sound** Babies know their biological mother’s voice even before birth. Once they are born, any primary caregiver’s voice becomes quickly recognizable. Your baby’s language learning begins with recognizing voices. Hearing a familiar voice (even in a recording) activates their brain’s speech-processing center.

**Knowing you by smell** Just as with sound, [a baby’s sense of smell](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/scent-and-your-newborn/) gets a head start in the womb. They began to smell (and taste) their mother’s amniotic fluid in utero. After birth, it only takes a few days before they can tell—and begin to prefer—their primary caregiver’s scent.

**Knowing you by sight** It takes at least a few weeks and maybe up to 2 months for a baby to discern their primary caregiver by sight. Right now, they can only see 8 to 12 inches away from their face, so bring them close ❤️  Your baby’s ability to recognize people by sight will improve as they get older. Some studies even suggest that 6-month-olds are much better at picking out individual faces from a crowd than adults are!
