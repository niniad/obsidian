Your pediatrician has their eye out for certain developmental milestones during checkups. At 2 months, your baby may be cooing, smiling at familiar faces, [following a moving object with their eyes](https://lovevery.com/community/blog/child-development/tracking-sights-and-sounds/), momentarily grasping something that’s placed in their hands, and beginning to lift their head during tummy time.

Your doctor will likely ask you about these and other developmental changes you’re noticing in your baby. Remember, there’s a window of time for what’s considered typical, so try not to worry if your baby isn’t doing everything on the list. Bring your questions to your baby’s pediatrician—that’s what they’re here for ❤️

## Leading up to the checkup

**Practice tummy time.** [Tummy time](https://lovevery.com/community/blog/child-development/yes-your-teeny-newborn-needs-tummy-time-but-why/) is one of the best ways to encourage your baby’s physical development, so your doctor will want to know how they’re doing. If your baby isn’t tolerating tummy time well, try these tips from Lovevery’s pediatric occupational therapist Rachel Coley:

* Place a rolled up towel underneath your baby’s neck and shoulders to encourage that lifting motion through the upper body.
* Allow your baby to do tummy time on your chest—just be sure both you and your baby are fully awake; stomach sleeping is not safe for your baby at this age.
* Place [high-contrast cards](https://lovevery.com/community/blog/child-development/the-best-high-contrast-images-for-newborns/) in front of them during tummy time to provide visual stimulation.
* Get down on your baby’s level, rub their back, and allow them to see your face during tummy time.

## The day of your baby’s 2-month doctor’s visit

**Pack a riveting plaything.** You already know that diapers and a change of clothes (for your baby *and* you 😉) are must-haves. Bring a [book with black-and-white images](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker) for your baby to look at during wait times.

**Give yourself time to get out the door.** Just like when [preparing for your newborn’s first doctor’s visit](https://lovevery.com/community/blog/child-development/preparing-for-your-newborns-first-doctors-visit/), it’s helpful to start getting ready a bit earlier than you think you need to. That way, you’re less stressed if you hit a snag.

## At the checkup

**For comfort, try a proven technique.** If your baby’s having a hard time with the exam or a shot, you can try a proven soothing method. Holding your baby while walking around a room is one of the best ways to calm them, research shows.

**Remember this is a time to check on parents, too.** The American Academy of Pediatricians recommends [pediatricians screen mothers for postpartum depression](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/126/5/1032/65293/Incorporating-Recognition-and-Management-of) (PPD) at well-baby checkups.   PPD is the most common obstetric complication in the U.S. and can actually impact fathers, too. The best thing you can do for yourself and your baby is to be honest about your feelings. The pediatrician can direct you toward help if you need it ❤️
