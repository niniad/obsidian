Most newborn babies can’t hold their heads pointed forward; you may notice that your baby’s head usually flops one way or the other. Because of how they were positioned in the womb, babies are actually born with a preference for turning their heads to a particular side.

Occupational therapists recommend turning your baby’s head from side to side to avoid a flat spot forming and neck muscles tightening.

## Here’s how to safely and gently turn your baby’s head:

* Gently turn your baby’s head from side to side when they’re in a carrier, during tummy time, while holding them, and when they’re awake on their back.
* If you notice they’re always looking to the same side, gently position them so they are facing the other way; offer them a [black and white image](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker) to look at.
