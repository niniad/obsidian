# Yes, your teeny newborn needs tummy time. But why?

Source: https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/yes-your-teeny-newborn-needs-tummy-time-but-why/

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends supervised tummy time for full-term babies starting in the first week.

For newborns, success may be very short sessions—a minute or two at a time, a few times a day. If they start crying, it’s time for a break.

## Here are some tips for newborn tummy time:

### 1. Put high-contrast playthings where your baby can see them

Put playthings right where your baby can see them—off to the side at their eye level for visual exploration. Right now, your newborn will do tummy time with their head turned to one side, either cheek down or with head slightly lifted.

### 2. Encourage new skills with gentle sensory play

While your newborn’s startle reflex is at its peak, an interesting sound can easily become a startling noise. Begin with a gentle, quiet rattle in a high-contrast design. While your baby is cheek down in tummy time facing away from you, shake the rattle and see if your baby lifts and turns their head toward the sound.

### 3. Extend tummy time with playthings that keep them engaged

When your baby loses interest in tummy time, your instinct might be to stop. But toys that offer novelty can make all the difference in keeping your baby engaged.

Try turning the page of the [Wooden Book](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker), showing your baby a new [Black and White Card](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker), or offering them a [Sensory Link](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker) to extend their belly-down time.

### More tips for newborn tummy time:

* Slowly roll your baby onto their tummy with arms tucked under their shoulders
* Newborns like to have their heads to one side while lying on their bellies, mimicking their position in the womb
* Periodically move your baby so their head rests on the opposite side; head-turning helps avoid [flat spots](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/the-facts-on-flat-head-syndrome/) and tight neck muscles
* As your baby gets stronger, place high-contrast cards in front of them so they work to see the images when lifting up their chin
* Put your baby on your chest facing you, and softly talk to them to try to encourage them to lift their head
* Put your baby belly-down on your thighs and gently rub their back; show them a [high-contrast card](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker) in their line of vision and slowly move it upward to see if their head moves up
* Carry your baby football-style on your forearm

If your baby is fussy during a tummy time session, you don’t have to force it. Keep trying short sessions a few times a day. Babies who start tummy time early take to it better later on. The experts all agree: tummy time is essential for building the muscles and coordination needed for rolling over, crawling, walking, reaching, and playing.
