![Baby looking at a Black and White Card by Lovevery](https://i0.wp.com/blog.lovevery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GENERAL-MARKETING-JUNE0168-3-Edit-e1631823160636.jpg?fit=3000%2C1777&ssl=1)

Your baby will continue to be fascinated with high-contrast images until they’re about 14 weeks old.

Notice how they may stare at the [Black & White cards](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-looker) for minutes at a time. If they’ve seen a particular card many times, they might not look as long. Your baby is craving more variety and complexity as the connections between their brain and eyes strengthen.

We created these [high-contrast images you can print](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2386/2119/files/SMF_Lovevery_SubscriptionBox_BWCards_BonusPack4_112117_Trim.pdf) for your card holders. You can also tape them up near your baby’s diaper-changing station or attach them to the sides of [The Play Gym](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-gym). Notice all the black and white that is already around you: a black-and white shirt, a high-contrast patterned pillow or blanket, or black picture frames against a white wall.
