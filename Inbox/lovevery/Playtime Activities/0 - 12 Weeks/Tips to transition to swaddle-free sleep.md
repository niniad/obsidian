[Swaddling](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/8-tips-for-safe-swaddling/) can be a helpful strategy to calm your baby and promote sleep in their first months of life. Once your baby reaches a certain developmental phase, however, swaddling is no longer safe. Depending on your baby’s progress, you may be able to make the transition out of a swaddle gradually.

## When to stop swaddling

When to stop swaddling depends on your baby’s development more than their age. Swaddling is no longer safe for your baby once they show signs of rolling over, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. This may happen as early as 2 or 3 months of age.

Early signs of rolling may include:

1. Reaching for their feet during playtime on their back
2. Rolling from their back to their side
3. Turning their face toward the floor or mattress when on their side

Stop using the swaddle as soon your baby begins to demonstrate these skills.

## 3 ways to transition to swaddle-free sleep

If your baby isn’t showing signs of rolling, you can make the change to swaddle-free sleep gradually.

1. **Leave one arm out while keeping your baby’s other arm securely wrapped**. A day or two later, leave both arms out. Finally, remove the swaddle altogether.
2. **Put your baby down for naps without a swaddle**. This can help them learn to sleep freely for short periods before they graduate to swaddle-free nights.
3. **Use a sleeveless sleep sack or wearable blanket**. These are safe for babies even after they roll because their arms are free.
