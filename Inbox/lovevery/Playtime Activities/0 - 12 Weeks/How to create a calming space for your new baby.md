Think of the first 4 weeks of your baby’s life as a transition time between the womb and the world. They emerge from a calm, quiet, cozy place into a bright, busy environment with lots of jumbled noises.

Over the next few months, your baby will start learning how to process and understand all of this sensory input. Until their brain matures, try to keep their surroundings tranquil and soothing.

Providing your baby with some quiet alert time during the day will allow them the chance to open their eyes, take in sounds, and slowly become aware of what’s around them. So much early learning happens for your baby at these times.

It may be hard to imagine your tiny newborn’s brain growing exponentially right now, but that is exactly what it is doing ❤️

## Provide protection from loud, jumbled noises

Imagine a typical coffee shop atmosphere with music playing, people talking, and glasses clinking. These kinds of environments can easily overstimulate your baby; they may ignore it all and go to sleep. That’s okay sometimes, but not all of the time.

In the first couple of months, try to limit excursions to loud, bright places with a lot of different people and voices. Your newborn prefers the sound of one human voice at a time and calm, rhythmic tones.

## Keep the lights low

A newborn’s eyes can take time to adjust to bright light. For the first few weeks, keep the lights dim and avoid direct sun. Use a dimmer switch, a low lamp, or curtains when your baby is awake. In dim light, they may open their eyes and look around for a few moments. This helps them practice using both eyes together and exercises their pupillary reflex, which makes the pupil dilate or constrict in response to different amounts of light.

## Stimulate one sense at a time

Your newborn is only awake for a few moments at a time. If you can, take a few minutes to tune into them when you notice their eyes opening. For example, you could softly talk to them face to face or gently stroke their skin. Hold up a high-contrast image for them to look at, or sing to them. The important thing is to choose only one of these activities at a time.

When your baby experiences multiple sources of sensory input at once, their brain responds protectively, and absorbs less or even none of the new information.
