Flashing-light toys can capture a baby’s attention, but they’re a little like empty calories for your baby’s brain. These distractions don’t help a baby’s eyes develop focus, gain the ability to track a moving object, or work togetWhen your baby first arrived, you were likely preoccupied with feeding them, changing their diapers, and trying to make sure everyone got at least a little bit of sleep 🙃 Now, your baby is more aware of the world around them. They’re ready to actively explore simple playthings and learn from experiences that show them how things work.

A house tour is an experience you can repeat in many different ways at many different times. Walk slowly from room to room, pausing to explore anything that might interest your baby: a faucet, a light switch, or even light coming through the window. For example, turn on the faucet and run your baby’s fingers under the cool water, narrating as you go. You could say, “We turned the water on and now your fingers are all wet.”

Giving your baby a house tour can teach them about cause and effect and expose them to new sensations, like a fan blowing gently on their face or the smooth, cool refrigerator door against the bottom of their foot. Don’t let the term “house tour” limit you—you can do this almost anywhere.   
Your baby learns best from a combination of experiences with you and simple playthings specifically designed for safe exploration. The ideal playthings mimic the natural sensations and cause and effect relationships like those your baby may observe on their house tours. For example, when you turn the faucet on all the way, you show your baby how the force and sound of the water increase. When they play with the **Rolling Bell** from [**The Charmer Play Kit**](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-charmer), that learning is reinforced because the harder they kick or bat it, the louder it gets.
