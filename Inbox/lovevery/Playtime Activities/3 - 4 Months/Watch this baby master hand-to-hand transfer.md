# Watch this baby master hand-to-hand transfer

Source: https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/watch-this-baby-master-hand-to-hand-transfer/

This is actually a big deal. Passing an object between two hands is a skill your baby will work toward for months and involves coordination across the center of their body. Skilled hand-to-hand transfer won’t happen until sometime between months 5 and 7. It’s their first step in getting dressed on their own, eating with utensils, and holding crayons.

[Joined discs](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-charmer) are a Montessori classic that help babies practice manipulating an object in one hand and eventually passing it to the other.  At first, your baby may grasp other objects (like rings or rattles) and struggle with the discs because they require more developed fine motor skills. Don’t worry if it takes some practice ❤️
