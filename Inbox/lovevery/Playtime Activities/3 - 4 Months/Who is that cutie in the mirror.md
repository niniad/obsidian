Mirror-gazing is a favorite activity for babies. Your baby doesn’t yet recognize their own face—that will come much later. But they get to see a fascinating (and adorable) human looking back at them. If your baby isn’t into the mirror yet, they likely will be soon.

## Here’s how to get the most out of mirror play with your baby:

* The [mirror](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-charmer) is great for tummy time reflections; keep it low so they have to lift their head to see it

* Add your reflection to theirs, making faces in the mirror while you have a “conversation” together
* Touch different parts of your face and theirs, naming each
* They may also like looking at the black and white illustration on the back of the mirror during tummy time

Your baby will start to smile at the baby they see in the mirror between 5 ½ and 8 ½ months ❤️
