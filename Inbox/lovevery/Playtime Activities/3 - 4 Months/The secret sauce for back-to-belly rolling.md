Rolling from back to belly is a skill that emerges from 3 to 5 months, but your baby is laying the groundwork for it now. Here’s exactly how to encourage this skill.

## Get your baby ready to roll

Where the head goes, the body will follow. A fun plaything such as the **Rolling Bell** provides both visual and auditory motivation for your little one to track with their eyes, which leads them to move their head from side to side while on their tummy.

Over the coming months, with a little shift of their weight and a push of their arm or foot, they’ll be rolling over from their tummy to their back (typically between 4 and 6 months) ❤️

## Everything you need to know about babies and rolling

It’s easy to feel concerned about milestones (especially during the first year) and natural to compare, but here’s a parent-to-parent reminder: your baby’s development path is unique. Development happens in ranges that can span weeks, even months.

Your baby might be really into [rolling](https://blog.lovevery.com/skills-stages/rolling/) as a way to get around or they might just roll occasionally. There is no study that shows a correlation between being an avid early roller and being a great athlete later in life, so don’t stress if your baby is still figuring out how to roll 😉.

Your baby will likely roll from belly to back much sooner than rolling from back to belly. Here are the average ranges for when babies start rolling:

* Back to side: babies typically roll from back to side between 4 and 5.5 months
* Belly to back: babies typically roll from belly to back between 4 and 6 months
* Back to belly: babies typically roll from back to belly between 5.5 and 7.5 months

A loving reminder: keep an eye on your baby, especially on the changing table, bed, or anywhere else there is a risk of falling. Babies as young as a few weeks old have been known to spontaneously roll over and fall off of a high surface.

### If your baby is working on rolling from back to side

Encourage your baby to practice kicking by putting them on their back with their legs and feet near the Making Sounds Zone of [The Play Gym](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-gym). You can find more kick play ideas [here](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/kicking-play-helps-your-baby-learn-to-roll/). Kicking strengthens your baby’s core and neck muscles and gets them ready to roll.

Plenty of tummy time will help your baby build muscles for rolling over; eventually, when on their tummy, they will kick their legs over and roll to their back. You will know your baby is getting ready to roll over when they use their hands to reach for objects in front of them while on their tummy, and when they can push up on their hands, straightening their arms to get higher.

Baby isn’t into tummy time? About half of Lovevery parents are with you 🙃 [Here](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/swimming-in-tummy-time-yet/) are some ways you can keep your baby happier during tummy time.

### If your baby is working on rolling from back to belly

After you notice your baby tucking their chin and pulling their legs in towards their body when they are on their back, encourage them to roll from back to belly by holding a ball or toy in their line of vision. When you move the toy to the side, they will have to roll over to see it.

## What parents are asking our experts…

> “My son is 3 months old and is not reaching for objects. He doesn’t really even wave his arms when a toy is hanging above. How do I encourage this?”

**Answer:**   
Babies typically begin extending their arms toward a rattle and moving their hands within a few inches of their midline (the center of their body) to reach for a plaything at around 3 to 5 months. So, at 3 months, your child is just starting to figure out how.

Early reaching is often just a brief lift of their arms off the floor (what we physical therapists call, antigravity movements), unrefined arm flailing, or opening and closing their hands with movement at their wrists in anticipation of making contact with a toy.

Laying your little one on his side to play (make sure to alternate sides) will make it easier for him to bring his hands to midline, get them to his mouth, reach, take in sensory input all over his body, and work toward rolling. While he’s on his side, place some playthings a few inches away from him (my favorites are the Sensory Strands and Rolling Bell), so he attempts to reach from a more gravity-neutral position.

Keep in mind that, despite the allure of the toys and your presence, your baby may not settle into a side-lying position for long. Here are some strategies for encouraging him to lie on his side:

* Let him roll into another position and then, after a pause, try again.
* Support his bottom and legs to help him rest comfortably on his side.
* Rock him back and forth gently when he gets a little fussy.

A few short sessions of side-lying each day are all he needs.
