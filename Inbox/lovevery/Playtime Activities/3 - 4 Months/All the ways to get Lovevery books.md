Lovevery books are beloved by millions of families for good reason: They’re stage-based and written to be fascinating to your child right now, and stay interesting as your child grows.

Newborn books are full of high contrast visuals, toddler books show routines like brushing teeth and bedtime, and books across ages help your child prepare for new experiences like a trip to the doctor or dentist, having a babysitter put them to bed, and potty learning.

## Lovevery books in The Play Kits

Every Play Kit comes with at least one stage-based book. Play Kits subscribers also get the best of Lovevery, with free access to developmental insights and ways to play in The Lovevery App, plus exclusive products and more books in their Subscriber Shop.
