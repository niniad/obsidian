Between 9 and 10 months, many babies start learning how to release, or drop, objects from their grip in a controlled and purposeful way. While this new fine motor skill can be frustrating for parents at times—especially [during meals](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/testing-limits-at-mealtimes/)—it’s an [important milestone](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/baby-development-milestones-by-month/) that can be encouraged with simple activities.

## Here’s how to support voluntary release

1. If they aren’t yet releasing objects voluntarily, you can gently tap, rub, or stroke the back of your baby’s hand to encourage them to open their fingers and let go.
2. Ask them to hand you an object they’re holding. This often works best if you have something to trade ❤️
3. Give them a kitchen pot and [wood blocks](https://lovevery.com/products/the-block-set) to drop into it. The satisfying sound the blocks make when they hit the bottom will inspire them to continue.
4. The [Ball Drop Box](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-inspector) is also a great tool for practicing this emerging skill.
