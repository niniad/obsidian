According to child development literature, your baby will likely “struggle against supine position,” between 6 and 12 months. This is nerd language for “your baby hates being on their back during diaper changes” 🙃

If this sounds familiar, it may be time to consider another approach to diapering. Advocates of standing diaper changes say that your baby might be more cooperative if you allow them to be involved in the process.

## Prepare your space ahead of time

* If you do it in the bathroom, a standing diaper change can help your baby begin to associate diapering with potty training and using a toilet.
* Bring diapers, wipes, and a pail into the bathroom. Store the supplies within easy reach.
* Provide your baby with a stable place to balance. The edge of a bathtub is the perfect height for babies to hold onto. You can also use the toilet with the lid closed or mount a pull-up bar on the wall.

## A standing diaper change in 4 steps

1. Many babies like to be a part of the process. You can ask them to pull wipes from the container and choose their next diaper.
2. Talk them through what’s happening, asking permission as appropriate: “Your diaper is dirty; it’s time to change it. May I pull down your pants?” They may not have the language to [communicate their consent](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/how-to-raise-a-child-who-understands-consent/) yet, but making it a habit to ask first shows you respect their autonomy.
3. Teach your baby to squat while you clean their bottom, or help them lift one leg at a time if the mess requires a more thorough cleaning (you can also reserve standing diaper changes just for pee).
4. Wash your hands together to complete the process.
