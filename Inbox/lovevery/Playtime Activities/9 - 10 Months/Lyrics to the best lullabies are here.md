Your baby will love hearing the sound of your familiar voice singing to them. Research suggests many benefits to singing songs. Lullabies can aid your baby’s language development and even reduce stress levels and pain. You can share sweet dreams with your baby with some of these old favorites.

**Twinkle Twinkle Little Star**

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,

How I wonder what you are!

Up above the world so high,

Like a diamond in the sky.

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,

How I wonder what you are!

**Rock-a-bye Baby**

Rock-a-bye baby, on the tree tops,

When the wind blows, the cradle will rock,

When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall,

And down will come baby, cradle and all.

**Hush Little Baby**

Hush, little baby, don’t say a word.

Papa’s\* gonna buy you a mockingbird

And if that mockingbird won’t sing,

Papa’s gonna buy you a diamond ring

And if that diamond ring turns brass,

Papa’s gonna buy you a looking glass

And if that looking glass gets broke,

Papa’s gonna buy you a billy goat

And if that billy goat won’t pull,

Papa’s gonna buy you a cart and bull

And if that cart and bull turn over,

Papa’s gonna buy you a dog named Rover

And if that dog named Rover won’t bark

Papa’s gonna buy you a horse and cart

And if that horse and cart fall down,

You’ll still be the sweetest little baby in town.

\**Use whatever name is appropriate: Mama, Grandma, Auntie, your own name, etc.*

**Day Is Done**

Day is done,

Gone the sun,

From the lake, from the hills, from the sky.

All is well, safely rest,

Night is nigh.

**Are You Sleeping? (Frère Jacques)**

Are you sleeping, are you sleeping?

Brother John, Brother John?

Morning bells are ringing, morning bells are ringing

Ding ding dong, ding ding dong

Frère Jacques, Frère Jacques

Dormez-vous, dormez-vous?

Sonnez le matines, sonnez le matines

Ding ding dong, ding ding dong
