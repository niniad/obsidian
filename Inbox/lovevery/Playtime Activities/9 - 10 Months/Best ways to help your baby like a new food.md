Research shows that introducing your baby to [more flavors](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/baby-food-doesnt-have-to-be-bland/) now increases the likelihood that they will accept and enjoy them later. Keep trying because it can take 10 or more exposures to a new food before a baby learns to like it.

## Avoid this common mistake

If your baby spits out a new food, scrunches up their face, or turns away, don’t assume that they dislike it. Just try offering it again at their next meal—and the one after that 😉 Be patient and trust that in time, your baby can learn to like almost any food.

## 4 ways to help your baby learn to like new foods

1. **Offer as many foods as you can**. Ignore your own food aversions when considering options for your baby. Be positive when they start to try it: “Yum, this is delicious!”
2. **Ignore time-of-day traditions**. Don’t be afraid to offer broccoli for breakfast. Let your baby try selections from any food group at any mealtime.
3. **Vary the textures**. Familiarize your baby with a variety of consistencies, such as pureed sweet potato, lumpy applesauce, slippery avocado slices, and small bits of soft bread.
4. **Let them [make a mess](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/sensory-play-and-why-letting-your-baby-get-messy-is-important/)**. Give your baby the freedom to explore their food. This keeps them present and curious, and if they enjoy the experience, they’re more apt to like the food.
