Chewing is a complex set of skills that can take years to develop and refine. Offering safe and supervised practice now is a great way to help your baby learn, says Lovevery pediatric occupational therapist Rachel Coley.

If you started your baby on simple purees and they’re now swallowing most of each spoonful, they may be ready to graduate to **fork-mashed solids**.

Fork-mashed solids do more than make purees thicker and less messy. Like pre-chewed food, the added texture can increase your baby’s oral awareness, giving their brain specific information about the food’s shape and size, along with where it is in their mouth.

When they first start eating solids, babies often use the familiar suckling movement to draw smooth purees off a spoon and into the back of their mouth. Introducing fork-mashed solids can encourage your baby to try chewing their food. Even if your baby isn’t consistently chewing yet, this texture is safe to swallow, so you don’t have to worry at mealtimes.

While your baby works hard to gain these new skills, Coley suggests starting with these fork-mashed foods:

### Ripe, soft, seasonal fruits:

Avocados

Bananas

Peaches

Pears

### Soft, cooked vegetables:

Beets

Butternut squash

Carrots

Potatoes

Sweet Potatoes

### Iron-rich foods

Black beans

Chicken, strained from a soup or stew

Scrambled eggs\*

Soft, flaked, de-boned, low-mercury fish\* (catfish, cod, crab, flounder, salmon, tilapia, trout)

\*Potential allergens

### How to prepare and serve fork-mashed solids:

With your fork, thoroughly mash several spoonfuls of food. The texture should be semi-solid, as if it’s been pre-chewed, with no large lumps or chunks. You may need to add a splash of liquid (water, breast milk, formula, or sodium-free broth) to reach the desired consistency. Based on your baby’s interest and self-feeding ability, you can offer preloaded spoons for them to bring to their mouth independently. This can get messy, but it’s an excellent opportunity for your baby to develop **fine motor skills** and **hand-eye coordination**. You can also spoon-feed them or provide assistance as needed.

### Safety note

Note: Lovevery cares about your baby’s well-being during the exciting transition into solid foods. Child safety is of utmost importance. Please consult your child’s pediatrician before introducing your child to solid foods. They will be able to give you individualized recommendations on the best age to begin, taking into account your child and your family’s health history.

All parents and caretakers should complete a baby CPR and first aid course from a certified instructor. This will help keep your child safe and give you additional peace of mind while exploring solid foods.

Solid food can present a choking hazard. Please use caution when experimenting with solids. Always ensure your baby is seated upright, in a highchair, and serve appropriate foods based on your baby’s skill level. All food should be thoroughly cooked and never forced into your baby’s mouth.  If choking occurs, please administer first aid based on your training and call 911 (or your local equivalent) immediately.

Closely monitor your baby’s reactions when experimenting with common allergens. If you notice a significant physical reaction such as hives, swelling of the lips, wheezing, or repeated vomiting, please seek immediate medical attention and consult with your child’s pediatrician before experimenting further.

Allergic reactions can be genetic in origin. If your child’s birth family has a history of significant allergies, please consult your child’s pediatrician and/or a pediatric allergist before experimenting with foods other than breast milk or formula.
