A ‘yes’ space is more than a [babyproofed](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/why-and-how-to-babyproof-early/) room in your home. Inspired by the RIE parenting method\*, a yes space is an enclosed area designated specifically for your baby where they can play without scooting away, getting hurt, or being told ‘no.’ The purpose, according to [RIE](https://blog.lovevery.com/podcast/understanding-rie-parenting/), is to give your baby the freedom to explore without interruption.

## How to create a yes space

Your baby’s yes space can be an entire room or part of one. Some parents install a safety gate or a gated play yard to make sure their baby doesn’t scoot or crawl out.

To make the space as safe as possible, be sure to secure any large furniture to the wall, cover electrical outlets, and move cords, plants, and decorative items (even on the wall) so they are well out of reach. Reevaluate the space as your child gets older to keep an eye on any dangers that may arise due to their physical growth and developing skills.

### 3 ideas for what to include

1. [Age-appropriate toys, balls, and playthings](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits)
2. Soft books that can be mouthed
3. Plastic containers and lids with rounded edges

## Keep an eye on your baby

Babies can come up with all sorts of creative ways to hurt themselves 🙃 As your baby becomes more mobile, it’s important that they have supervision.

## Resist using the yes space *too* much

Overusing the yes space can be tempting, but resist the urge to use it for all of your child’s playtime. Neuroscience reveals that babies’ brains crave novelty. Give your baby supervised access to lots of different environments—various floor textures, [light sources](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/the-benefits-of-bringing-your-baby-outside/), and stimulating items from around the house to investigate. A balance of independent play and [interaction with a caregiver](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/what-is-serve-and-return-and-why-is-it-so-important/) is also really important ❤️

\*RIE is a parenting method focused on respect for the child—what they’re thinking and feeling, as well as what they can do with less instruction. RIE is about giving children dignity through clear communication, independence, validation of feelings, and a recognition that they are already a person who deserves respect.
