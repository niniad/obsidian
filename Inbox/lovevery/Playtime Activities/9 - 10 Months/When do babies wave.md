# When do babies wave?

![Fact: Waving is one of your baby's earliest forms of social communication](https://i0.wp.com/blog.lovevery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Month9_FactGraphic_4.11.22.jpg?fit=2048%2C1214&ssl=1)

Between 8 and 12 months, many babies start to wave “hello” and “goodbye.” These seemingly simple gestures actually combine at least three distinct types of skills:

1. **Cognitive**: waving begins as imitation, which means your baby needs to see you wave, understand that the gesture has meaning, and try it on their own.
2. **Gross motor**: whether your baby’s wave involves rotating their wrist like they are in a parade, flapping their hand like a bird, or moving their arm up and down, they’re using their hands and arms in a coordinated and intentional way.
3. **Social communication**: your baby isn’t just learning how to communicate through gestures—they’re discovering that communication has a social component.

## Observing you and others leads to action

Seeing another person’s hand move activates a part of your baby’s brain called the sensorimotor strip, which tells them to move their own hand in a similar way. This neural response, known as “somatotopy,” explains how young children learn new skills and social customs through [imitation](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/copy-your-baby-to-help-them-learn/). Babies actually learn to clap in the same way.

## 4 ways to encourage waving

1. Demonstrate by gently holding your baby’s hand and waving it as you say “Hi!” or “Bye-bye!”
2. Wave hello and goodbye to them when you leave a room or put them down for a nap.
3. Practice waving “Hello” and “Goodbye” to a favorite doll or stuffed animal while playing peekaboo or [looking in a mirror](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/who-is-that-cutie-in-the-mirror/).
4. When your baby waves, be sure to acknowledge and return the gesture ❤️
