It’s easy to feel frustrated when your baby dumps over a bowl of snacks or pulls a row of board books off a shelf. But destructive play actually teaches them important lessons about cause and effect, [gravity](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/4-early-gravity-lessons/), physics, and how various pieces can form a whole.

## How to support this kind of play

You can allow a certain amount of destructive play without encouraging your baby to dump their bowl of food over 🙃 If you notice your baby dumping or [dropping food on the floor](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/the-fine-motor-skill-babies-love-and-parents-sometimes-hate/), you can try giving them a more practical alternative. Rip up a piece of paper together, or offer them a stack of board books, plastic food storage containers, or blocks to knock over, or a completed puzzle to overturn.

**Here are some tips that may help:**

1. If your baby is knocking over something that doesn’t matter to you or make a big mess, resist the urge to immediately start picking up after them.
2. Narrate the process to give language and meaning to what your baby is doing: “Crash!!! The blocks fell over. That made a loud sound!”
3. Be a partner in play—help your baby overturn a bin of toys or topple a [stack of blocks](https://blog.lovevery.com/playtime-activities/why-wooden-blocks-are-actually-the-best-stem-toy/).
4. If you have space, [keep a ‘yes’ cabinet or space](https://blog.lovevery.com/child-development/creating-a-yes-space-for-your-baby/) where your baby can remove items and make a mess without a lot of adult intervention.
5. If your baby does get into something important, redirect them to a safe alternative.
6. When your baby makes a mess, model how to clean up and put things back together. At this age, they aren’t able to do it themselves: they’re still learning how to put objects in a container ❤️
