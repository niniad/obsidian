The 9-month sleep regression isn’t as commonly known as the one that happens at 4 months, but it can be just as frustrating.

Here are a few things that could be disrupting your baby’s sleep right now:

1. Separation anxiety may be emerging and cause distress when you place your baby in their crib and leave the room.
2. They may be shifting from three naps to two, which can disrupt their sleep schedule.
3. Developmental leaps can affect your baby’s sleep. They may be learning to crawl now or even pulling up and preparing to take some first steps.

## 5 strategies to help you and your baby get more sleep

### 1. Try an earlier bedtime

If your baby has dropped their third nap, they may become overtired by the end of the day. An early bedtime (even as early as 6 p.m.) can help ensure a better night’s sleep.

### 2. Help as needed

Babies often work on skills in their sleep before they practice them during the day. You may find them standing in their crib crying because they have no idea how to lie back down. It’s okay to help when this happens.

### 3. Give them extra cuddle time

Add a few minutes of extra snuggles to minimize separation anxiety. If you can, consider starting your baby’s bedtime routine a little earlier so their naps and bedtimes remain consistent. If your baby uses a pacifier, offer it during cuddle time so they associate it with you. You can leave the pacifier in their crib to assist with self-soothing.

### 4. Offer reassurance

 If your baby cries when you put them in their crib, it’s okay to pick them up. Hold them for a minute or two, and then put them back down. You can place a hand on their back as you sing them a song or talk to them softly. Remember, habits aren’t established in a single night.

### 5. Remember it’s just a phase

A sleep regression can be really hard on both of you. If you’re feeling anxious or stressed because your baby is crying and needs more of you than usual, remember that this will pass, and take a few deep breaths before you try to soothe them ❤️
