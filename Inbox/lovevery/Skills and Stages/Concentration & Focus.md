Is it hard to get your toddler to focus on an activity or sit and read a book? Do they seem easily distracted or lose interest in a toy quickly? It’s natural to worry about their ability to focus, but a short attention span is both common and expected at this age. As their brain develops, their concentration will grow. In the meantime, there are simple ways to help your child learn to focus and pay attention.

## Why do babies and toddlers have such short attention spans?

Your child’s brain develops rapidly during the first few years of their life. They constantly process new information, make neural connections, and learn about the world around them. This continuous influx of data can make it challenging for them to stay focused on a single object or task for very long.

But their inability to pay attention to one thing may actually have a developmental upside. It allows them to take in a wider variety of information about their environment. Some researchers believe that this phase helps babies and toddlers gain crucial knowledge that they’ll need later on in life.

## How do concentration and focus develop?

At birth, your baby’s visual attention is guided by reflex. When an object appears within their field of vision, they may look at it briefly but can’t deliberately focus on it. This is because they’re just learning how to process and understand what’s happening around them.

Between 6 and 12 months of age, your baby’s attention span and ability to concentrate are still limited, but they’re beginning to direct their attention. They can focus longer on objects that interest them, like a moving ball or a [set of keys](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-explorer).

The gradual development of focus and concentration continues throughout early childhood and even into adolescence. Mostly enabled by the prefrontal cortex, these skills increase as it matures.

## Why are focus and concentration important for children?

Focus and concentration are necessary for your child to succeed in school as well as in many other aspects of their life.

### Academic skills

It takes focus to learn how to count, recognize patterns, and sound out words.  Studies suggest that children with strong concentration tend to learn reading and math more quickly than other children. That’s why these executive function skills play a key role in school readiness.

### Motor skills

Developing both fine and gross motor coordination requires children to imitate and repeat precise movements. A longer attention span allows them to concentrate on practicing these skills without getting distracted.

### Emotional regulation

Children with longer attention spans tend to have better impulse control. They’re able to think through their actions and reactions or use strategies like deep breathing to calm down before acting on their emotions.

## How long can I expect my child to focus at each age?

Every child develops focus and concentration at their own rate, but here are some averages based on age:

### Attention span in babies, toddlers & preschoolers: by the ages

**0 to 2 months:** several seconds while looking at a toy

**3 to 6 months:** 1 minute or less

**7 to 12 months:** up to 1 minute—maybe more with your support

**12 to 18 months:** up to 2 minutes

**19 to 24 months:** up to 3 minutes

**25 to 36 months:** up to 6 minutes

**37 to 48 months:** up to 8 minutes

**4 to 5 years:** up to 15 minutes

### Factors that may influence your child’s attention span

At every stage, your child’s ability to pay attention can be influenced by different factors, like:

* Interest in a particular activity
* Fatigue, hunger, or overstimulation
* Toy overload—some studies have found that toddlers engage in longer bouts of play in environments with fewer playthings
* Background noise from a television or other source

## How can I improve my child’s concentration and focus?

Even though your child’s ability to concentrate depends on the gradual maturation of their brain, you can take steps to support their development of this skill.

### Play with them

Have you ever noticed that an activity holds your baby’s or toddler’s attention longer when you participate? This is because, even at this young age, their brains thrive on human connection. In fact, research shows that joint attention is a key aspect in how infants and toddlers develop the ability to concentrate. So, simply by playing with your child and pointing out interesting things to them, you may be encouraging the development of their focus and concentration skills.

### Try not to interrupt their moments of focus

Signs of focus may include getting quiet, staring at or exploring an object for several minutes, making a serious or unusual facial expression, opening and closing their mouth, and even sticking out their tongue ❤️ When it happens, resist the urge to comment or interject. If your child looks up at you, you can smile to acknowledge them. If they begin to struggle, wait to see if they can find a solution on their own before you assist.

### Encourage their efforts

Offering a suggestion or praise in a positive tone can help your child stay focused on a difficult task. If they start to give up on a challenging puzzle, you can say, “I see a yellow, round piece that looks like it might fit there,” as you point to the piece and its place. If they persist and stay focused, you can say, “You kept trying that tricky puzzle, and then you figured it out!”

As you watch your toddler, comment on their actions or what they can do next. One study showed that when parents used phrases like, ”Let’s roll the ball!” their toddlers engaged in richer, deeper play experiences.

### Follow their lead

In research studies, even 18-month-olds were better able to focus when their parents supported their play of choice rather than redirecting them toward another activity. So pay attention to what your child looks at or reaches for, and then focus on it with them.

If they’re focused on doing something that you’d rather they not do, like tearing the pages from a book, try to find a more acceptable activity that allows them to work on the same skill. You could offer them some scratch paper to tear.

When your child starts to crawl or walk, they may become less interested in focused, seated activities. They’ll likely want to practice their newfound motor skills—all the time. If they prefer to walk, run, and climb, let them. Movement is actually good for building concentration, too 😉

## Activities to improve attention and concentration

![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.lovevery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Roman_Box3_0525_VS_R2a.jpg?resize=1024%2C607&ssl=1)

### Babies

Your baby’s brain hasn’t matured enough yet for them to focus on anything for long. But research suggests that even brief moments of practice can help build their attention span.

**Simple sounds****: 0 to 4 months**With your hand over your baby’s, show them how to explore a [rattle](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-charmer) by grasping, turning, and shaking it. Researchers found that babies who did this with their parents 10 minutes a day for two consecutive weeks showed increased attention span.

**Face-to-face play: 3 to 7 months**Your baby loves looking at your face ❤️ They learn a lot from studying your expressions, eyes, and mouth movements. In these early months, face-to-face play can help your baby learn to focus their attention, understand social cues, and build a strong connection to you.

Tap into your baby’s natural interest in faces by attaching a card from the [Faces Card](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-gym) Set or a [Mirror Card](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-gym) to the clips in [The Play Gym](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-gym). Lay your baby below, draw their attention to the card, and talk to them about what they see.

**Exploring real tools: 7 to 8 months** Gather some plastic containers with lids, a rubber spatula, a whisk, and a pastry brush and demonstrate how you use them for your baby.

**Storytime: 9 to 12 months**As you read, use a high-pitched, exaggerated voice and point out pictures with subjects your baby can relate to, like animals, toys, or characters who are siblings or grandparents.

### Toddlers

Your toddler may bounce from one activity to another, but they’re gradually learning to focus for longer periods of time. Try offering a variety of activities or playthings that involve using their hands to explore.

**Nesting kitchen bowls: 13 to 18 months**Nesting cups, bowls, and other objects in sets of graduated sizes are excellent for problem-solving. The task may seem simple, but it requires your toddler to understand how parts fit together to make a whole.

* Sit with your toddler on the floor with a few child-safe nesting bowls and demonstrate how to put one inside another.
* Explain what you’re doing as you go, emphasizing words related to size: “I’m putting the *small* bowl into the *big* bowl. See how it fits?”
* Encourage your child to try nesting the bowls.
* Your toddler may be able to nest only two at first, but give them a full set. They can play with the bowls in plenty of other fun ways 🙂

**Threading beads: 16 to 18 months**

This classic Montessori activity helps build a variety of early skills, including concentration and focus. As your toddler strings beads from the [Threadable Bead Kit](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-adventurer), they learn to maintain both visual and mental focus. Try not to distract or interrupt them when they’re concentrating.

![Threadable Bead Kit from The Adventurer Play Kit ](https://i0.wp.com/blog.lovevery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2022_05_19_APP_Alena_3964.jpg?resize=1024%2C607&ssl=1)

**Active play: 18+ months**

Once your toddler starts to walk, it may seem like they never sit still. Though it may seem counterintuitive, all this movement can actually improve their ability to focus. Research suggests that physical activity may help activate parts of the brain that help children focus and sustain attention.

* Put the base of the [Wooden Stacking Peg Board](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-adventurer) on the floor and the pegs on a low table or ottoman. Or, tape a large piece of contact paper to a wall, sticky side out, and stick a bug from the [Fuzzy Bug Shrub](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-adventurer) to it. This encourages your toddler to alternate between standing and squatting as they play.
* Invite your toddler to transport their playthings from place to place. Provide a small bag for carrying the [Bunnies](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-babbler) from the Felt Burrow. Offer the [Buddy Stroller](https://lovevery.com/products/the-buddy-stroller) for wheeling the [Soft Cotton Baby Doll](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-thinker) around. Set out a box or laundry basket for pushing favorite toys to a new spot to play.
* Create an obstacle course using [The Play Tunnel](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-tunnel) and the [Jump-In Hoops & Bean Bags](https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits-the-investigator). Lay the hoops in a row on the floor at the end of the tunnel. Encourage your toddler to crawl through the tunnel and then hop or step into each of the hoops. For added fun, pile up the bean bags and show your child how to toss them, one by one, into a basket to finish the course.

## Concerns about focus and concentration

Focus and concentration skills improve with practice, so a short attention span is expected in young children. If you feel your child struggles to maintain focus during play or at school, reach out to their pediatrician. The doctor can assess your child’s development and recommend further testing, if needed.
